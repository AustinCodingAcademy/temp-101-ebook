## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

### Part One: Calculator App

As a class,

- [ ] Fork and clone the [Calculator App Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/calculator-app-101) into your `devFolder` or wherever you've been building your projects: `git clone https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/calculator-app-101.git`
- [ ] Go to the `README.md` file to find the rest of your instructions.

> NOTE: Here is an [Overview Video of the repo](https://vimeo.com/395247060/835ad9038f).

### Part 2: Contact Page

* Group Students in pairs
  * plan and implements
* Partner with other groups for elaboration
* Share with the class for evaluation (potentially carry into the next class)

Just like the About Page you built for your Portfolio Website last class, tonight you're going to build a Contact Me Page that is responsive to mobile, tablet, & laptop that includes the following:

- [ ] `<input>` for Email that is required and validates for an actual email address
- [ ] `<textarea>` that has a placeholder "comments" and limits the user to 500 characters and minimum of 20.
- [ ] A section of checkboxes that asks the user: "How did you hear about me?"

    * [ ] Classmate
    * [ ] Resume Submission
    * [ ] LinkedIn
    * [ ] Coding Academy Rec

- [ ] A section of radio buttons that asks if the user wants to be contacted back: Yes or No
- [ ] Offer to give an optional Birthday Wish by submitting their birth date through a `date` input.
- [ ] Remember your design must be designed for mobile, tablet, and laptop!
- [ ] Remember to have a submit button and create a `result.html` to capture the values for now until we get to building servers that can receive and hold the data.
- [ ] After you've completed the contact page turn in the live link to in your Zollege Textbook.

  > HINT: You could use this [repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/html-form-practice-101) to get started faster!

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Next class, you'll be building a small business's website
- [ ] Look ahead and start wireframing what that will look like.
- [ ] Look ahead and see if you can get a jump on git branching.
- [ ] Rebuild another [Calculator](https://codepen.io/lalwanivikas/pen/eZxjqo) if you're up for it!

## Blogs to Show You Know

[Blog Prompts](./../additionalResources/blogPrompts.md) 

## Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders, 5 mins

- [ ] Create Contact Page Assignment
- [ ] Create 103 Blog Assignment
- [ ] Prepare for next by completing all of your pre-class lessons
- [ ] Complete the feedback survey(if applicable)
- [ ] Bring pencil and paper to class for wireframing!

Next week we'll slow down a bit by going deeper into `img`, `video`, block/inline elements and animations to build a small business website for our 1st Checkpoint and a Contact & About Page for our personal Portfolio Website.
