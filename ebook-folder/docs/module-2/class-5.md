### Part One: Tic Tac Toe

- [ ] Fork and clone the [TicTacToe-101 Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/TicTacToe-101) into your `devFolder` or wherever you've been building your projects:
  * `git clone https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/TicTacToe-101.git`
- [ ] Go to the `README.md` file to find the rest of your instructions.

### Part Two: About.html

Your Portfolio Website has been up for a couple weeks now but doesn't have an About Me Page to help people know more about you. Let's change that.

1. Draw up a wireframe of an about page you think will represent you well. **Don't let great be the enemy of good**.
  
  > MEANING: Don't spend to much time on the design or content but instead decide quickly and start coding. You're in a coding school not a design school. It can be a simple page!

1. Your design must be for mobile, tablet, and laptop!
1. You can use other websites as inspiration:

    * [About 8-hour Day](http://eighthourday.com/studio)
    * [About Kero1](https://www.kero1.com/about/)
    * [About Nike](https://about.nike.com/)

1. Now go find your Portfolio Folder from Day 1 of this course, open it up and create a new `.html` file called `"aboutPage"` then create a `.css` file called `"about-styles"` to build this page in.

1. Use all of the tools you've learned about so far and take this About Page to the next level.
1. Remember to link the new page to your Portfolio's landing page.
1. Remember your design must be designed for mobile, tablet, and laptop!
1. `git` `status` `add` `status` `commit` push your work up to its repo.
1. Then go to the URL that the website is hosted at and navigate to the "aboutPage" and copy/paste that URL to turn it in.

## Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders, 5 mins

- [ ] Create TicTacToe Assignment for a [pull request](https://youtu.be/rgbCcBNZcdQ?t=54) link.
- [ ] Prepare for next class by completing all of your pre-class lessons
- [ ] Bring pencil and paper to class for wireframing!
- [ ] Complete the feedback survey(if applicable)

Next class we'll work more with DOM Event Listeners and Properties to build a calculator. Spend extra time reviewing what you've learned the past few days and what's between now and next class.
