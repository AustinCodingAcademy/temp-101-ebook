# Our Job as Web Developers

At any given point of a web developer's typical work day they are doing one these three jobs:

1. Storing Data
2. Moving & Manipulating Data
3. Rendering Data

## Data & Our Three Jobs

These are the three jobs of a web developer(along with researching how to store, move, or render data ;). These three tasks might not mean much to you right now but moving forward we will use these as template for solving any problem we come across while developing web-based software. Let's clear up the meaning of these jobs so we can come back to them again and again in the future:

First, data is another word for information. It's a broadly used term to describe anything that describes something else. I.e. data about you could be your age, address, phone number, email, parents, list of friends, type of car you drive, pets, books you've read, etc... Other data might include how many people have entered and exited a store within a window of time(COVID-19) or how many purchase someone has made online versus in stores. Data also includes the colors we see on our screen and scrolling effects and the font sizes. For now, all of it is data to us and we must learn to think of it as a ubiquitous term that is omnipresent in all future work.

Second **Storing Data** has to do with holding data in a certain place whether that be a database, local storage, cookies, or a variable. Store data is critically important because we need to use that data later and computers can only do one thing at a time. (more on this later!)

Next, **Moving & Manipulating Data** means that data has to move from storage to render or render to storage and all other place in-between. But sometimes, the data we get is hard to give to the browser so we have to kneed it a little to get the exact bits of data we want and leave the bits we don't want. 

  > Moving & Manipulating is where we'll spend the first part of this course and most of 211 learning and practicing.

Finally, **Rendering Data** is the act of converting numbers and letters into visual and auditory elements that people(users) can see, hear, and interact with. When we say render the data, we mean, "get it on the screen".
