As we've stated before, this program isn't just about creating a web developer out of you but so so much more! We want you to create your own business, develop deep and rich relationships, serve your community, and rise to your full human potential! You can do all of this through web development but you can't do it without developing yourself while you do.

In the firsts few week we learned how to practice mindfulness and how it trains you to focus your thoughts, energy, and emotions toward what you want when you want it then we learned about self-motivation and what it means to tie yourself to what you're doing and do it for you and not for others.

This week we'll look a how all the "regular" and "normal" habits we do are actually tearing away at our creative abilities and our chance at conscious happiness and purpose but how we can accept change in our life to improve our heath in all of our realms: physical, mental, and spiritual. Let's get to work.

Take the time that is needed to read this article and practice your mindful practice so you can take charge of your life and really make monumental changes with a conscious and awakened approach.

But if you want to continue the asleep and unfulfilling path of *TL;DR*:

* Physical Inactivity = Mental Slowdown
* Multitasking = Low Concentration Ability
* Overload = Overstimulation = Lower IQ
* Physical Sitting = Mental Slog
* Screen Time = Low Emotional Wellbeing = Low Mental Wellbeing
* Loud Music = Dementia
* No Sleep = No mental health

To summarize, if you consciously approach these tactics and the challenges you have in life from child raising, rent payments, car troubles, learning to code, and family dynamics - you can learn to remove your personal emotions and see everything from a higher perspective which will give you the space and time to make better decisions as to how you react and what in your life needs to be removed, changed, and added. It's all about perspective and all we have to do to [obtain newer and higher perspectives](https://www.treeoflifeteachings.com/6-getting-a-higher-perspective/) is to become aware of ourselves in each of the challenging situations we find ourselves in...the rest will follow.

## Coding Music

Coding Music
Now to the fun, easy stuff....Yeah, music!!

When you're coding it's important that you maintain concentration. Yes, that constantly vanishing substance our maniacal "fast and forward" society regards as a by-product, concentration. Each of us has our own way of creating that concentration but if you haven't begun learning about yourself and what works for you then now is the best time to do so!!

- [ ] First suggestion, get some [good noise cancelling headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-4-50-Headphones-Cancellation/dp/B01MSZSL4I/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1HJO73UU4HY7A&keywords=sennheiser+wireless+headphones&qid=1583262042&sprefix=sennheiser%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-4).
Then find the music that works for you. Try these out:
- [ ] YouTube
    * [ ] [Chill lofi Beats to Code To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmVKaAV_7-A)
    * [ ] [4hrs of Ambient Study Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjkrrmBnpGE)
    * [ ] [2hrs Study Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzk5ohWYtAU)
    * [ ] [2hrs of Study Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PErqizZqLjI)
    * [ ] [2hrs of Electronic Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4fv-BtzNmY)
- [ ] Spotify
    * [ ] [Electronic Concentration on Spotify]()
    * [ ] [Code Crazy]()
    * [ ] [Flying with Glass]()
- [ ] And third, learn about music that also helps you not concentrate but instead relaxes you: [Reduce Anxiety with This Song](https://medium.com/inc./neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent-d69ae1343a27)

## Gravatar

The days of anonymity on the web are long gone. Nowadays we don't hide behind silly usernames like we did on AOL. Instead we show off who we are. We recognize the internet as part of our real world and therefore we express ourself and represent ourselves in it. We also find jobs, get hired and work on the internet now. Because we use it and [rely on it so much](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/americas-broadband-divide-revealed), shouldn't the internet be free and unfettered like say, [Net Neutrality](https://www.wired.com/story/guide-net-neutrality/)? I digress... The point is, you need a good picture to show who you are to your colleagues and employers. Gravatar is a way to do that.

Gravatar is a service provided by WordPress that connects your email and picture so that anywhere you go that uses Gravatar (about 35% of the internet) you will have a picture/avatar.
