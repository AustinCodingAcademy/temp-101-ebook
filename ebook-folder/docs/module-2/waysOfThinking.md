# Ways Of Thinking

Now that we have a better understanding of what we'll be doing in our next job role let's get into ways of thinking that will help us grasp the invisible medium we will be working with: electrons & binary!

Electrons. The [way computers work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA) does seem like magic. There's a lot going on "under-the-hood" that most of us have never been introduced to. Don't worry, most people have no idea that there is a grid underneath their phone's screen that catches their finger presses in an x-y coordinate and uses resistors to interpret where the press was and where the swipe ends. No doubt, there's some seriously fancy engineering going on in there that we don't need to understand but nevertheless, the data that results from those gestures ends up on the developers desk where we get to build software that can interact with a human and their fingers.

Binary. You've probably heard of binary, the language of computers! Yes, it is real and is still used. Thankfully, we as web developers don't need to understand binary because we get to develop software while standing on the shoulders of giants, who over decades have developed tools, or abstractions, of the basics of computer science. These abstractions are useful for more rapid development of software because we don't have to figure out how to communicate to our computer the color of red in binary, 111111110000000000000000 or the action of a button every time we have a new idea for an app. Instead, we build with these abstractions like HTML, JS, & CSS that already have pre-built definitions of the color red or the action of a button. All we have to do is learn the languages...these abstracted tools that help us develop faster!

## What Layer of Abstraction are We?

Since we're not physicist observing electrons passing through our phone screen and binary representing red actions, where are we actually developing? What level of abstraction are we working in if not in electrons or binary? In this course and the entire program, we'll be building websites and web apps that depend on the pre-determined structure of a computer and the HTTProtocol we've just learned about earlier. That structure and protocol are just two of the many layers of abstracted tools that we get to use to build!

To answer the question, in web development we are working at about the 10th layer of abstraction.

* 1st - Electrons and Transistors
* 2nd - DRAM memory and a [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) using binary(1s & 0s)
* 3rd - Bits & Bytes
* 4th - Logic Gates - [AND, NOT, NAND, OR, XOR, ADDER](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/logic-gate-AND-OR-XOR-NOT-NAND-NOR-and-XNOR)
* 5th - Functions - small packets of instructions
* 6th - Operating System - computing the memory with functions
* 7th - Service Workers - small but massively important programs that keep your computer running smoothly
* 8th - Interpreters - programs used to interpret instructions from other apps into binary
* 9th - Browser App - an app that interprets your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visual elements with executable actions.
* 10th - HTTP, HTML, CSS, JS **<-- where we are now!**
* 11th - Libraries and Frameworks **<-- where we'll be in 211, 311, & 411**

**IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE YOU DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE FIRST 9 LAYERS OF ABSTRACTION!** Use this list to appreciate the work many scientists and engineers have done to create the environment we are lucky to inherit and develop within AND to know that these layers of abstraction create the fundamentals of how computers operate and communicate with one another. This means that our HTML, CSS, and JS code is just following the same foundational principals of computer science. Now all that's left to do is learn to use these abstracted tools(layers) to build website and web apps!

To learn and use these tools/abstractions doesn't require a CS degrees or knowledge of bits, bytes, interpreters, or service workers. It only requires you to see this development world from two perspectives at the same time while keeping another idea in mind, Object Modeling.
