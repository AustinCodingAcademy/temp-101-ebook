As we learn more skills, we practice them, thereby deepening our understanding of their purpose. Today, a close friend of yours will ask you if you could build them a website for their new hair salon. They cut great hair but they have no way for people to find out about them. They found a couple sites they like and have sent them to you (the mockups are below.) They want all the pages that are there, they don't care about having the exact content right now, they just want to have a site that looks like them and their style so using Lorem Ipsum is fine right now.

Since each of you have different friends, the name of the salon or barbershop will be named differently. You can come up with the name of it and then use some creativity to change up the site just a little from the examples below but not so much that you get overwhelmed with design instead of building a site. *Don't let great be the enemy of good.*

### The Mockups

You may choose one of the following websites to build and you may use artistic licensing to make reasonable adjustments to the website. But, you must create all of the pages that are in the website: Landing, About, Contact, Gallery, and Blog/News page.

- [ ] [Zizurz Hair Salon](https://freewebsitetemplates.com/preview/hairstylesalon/index.html)
- [ ] [Mustacchio](https://freewebsitetemplates.com/preview/mustacheenthusiast/index.html)

### Instructions

- [ ] Decide on the website style you'd like to design. Decide on the name of the company you're building it for.
- [ ] Look at the assignments you've already created: About Page, Contact Me, Image Gallery, Landing Page, and NASA page for your blog/news. What can you reuse? How can you leverage the code you've already written to build this massive project? They want it in a week. You'll need to get creative.
- [ ] After looking at your other pages, draw up your wireframes for your chosen website, for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- [ ] Create a new repo with a `README` file called: "hairSalonWebsite".
- [ ] Suggestions:
        * [ ] Search for images on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) to download and use.
        * [ ] Use [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to get the best fonts
- [ ] Make it mobile! As you structure your page, be sure to test on both desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- [ ] `git status`, `add`, `commit` often!

    > NOTE: This is something you should start doing as you code, to back up your work in case your computer goes down, water is spilled, or whatever. `git commit`!

    > NOTE 2: This project will be due a week from now so get going smartly, swiftly, and safely!

- [ ] Host the website on GitHub and turn in the live URL for your grade.

This project isn't due *this* Sunday, it's due *next* Sunday, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't begin working on it now! Get going tonight by wireframing, copy/pasting code from other projects, and draw up a plan of action to break this large project into smaller projects.
