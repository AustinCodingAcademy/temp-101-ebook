# Intro To JavaScript

*“I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge. That myth is more potent than history. That dreams are more powerful than facts. That hope always triumphs over experience. That laughter is the only cure for grief. And I believe that love is stronger than death.” ―Robert Fulghum, All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten: Uncommon Thoughts On Common Things*

First off, JavaScript(a front-end language) is nothing even close to Java(a back-end language). [Please do not confuse the two](https://medium.com/@benastontweet/lesson-1a-the-history-of-javascript-8c1ce3bffb17). The naming of JavaScript was a marketing tactic at the time of creation to make programmers feel comfortable with the new language and increase its popularity. This marketing ploy worked and now its the only programming language browsers can read, but, from here on out remember: **Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpet**.

So, HTML creates a structure of "things", or objects/elements for us to manipulate the **properties** and **methods** of. Remember, HTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. This means that the elements we create with it do much more than just create text or images on a screen, they are interactive, they have **properties** that can be changed with CSS, and **methods** that can be used with JavaScript. In this way, each of these HTML elements are pieces that can be played with to do what we want. We're just learning a new language that will launch us into a new way to access and play with these Hyper-Text Elements!! So let's get to it...but first, let's take a high perspective look at what's going on.
