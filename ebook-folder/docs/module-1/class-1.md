    * [ ] What's your name?
    * [ ] What do you currently do?
    * [ ] Why do you want to get into Web Development?
    * [ ] What do you like to do to exercise your mind?
 - [ ] **3 mins** - **Virtually:** switch-up breakout rooms. **In-person:** Now turn to your left or right and find another aspiring developer. Ask them these questions:
    * [ ] What's your name?
    * [ ] Have you always lived in Austin? Where?
    * [ ] What do you know about the tech world?
    * [ ] Do you have any pets? Species? Names?
 - [ ] **3 mins** - **Virtually:** switch-up breakout rooms. **In-person:** Now turn the opposite way and find another collaborator. Ask them these questions:
    * [ ] What's your name?
    * [ ] Tell me about an interesting book or article you've read lately?
    * [ ] What do you think about when you watch the stars?
    * [ ] What is a dream of yours you are willing to work toward and figure out how to bring it to fruition?
 - [ ] **3 mins** - **Virtually:** switch-up breakout rooms. **In-person:** Last time, get up and walk to the other side of the classroom to find a different colleague to ask them these questions:
    * [ ] What's your name?
    * [ ] What's your Zodiac sign?
    * [ ] What daily self-care methods do you practice to maintain good health?
    * [ ] What is a fear you have about this course?
    * [ ] How do you plan to overcome it?
 - [ ] **15 mins - Show-And-Tell:** Finally, introduce your new (last/most recent) friend to the class. One at a time, go around sharing with the class you're new friend: Here's an example:

  > "Hello, my friend, James, is a Libra, born Oct 15th. He says that journaling, drinking water, and running helps him sleep soundly and have bright useful days. He's nervous that he doesn't know computers well enough but he thinks if he keeps reading, breathing, and resting his mind he can stay focused on the marathon and not the dash!"

  > **Everyone should introduce their new friend.**

### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 35 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

### Student Presentation Organization

  Knowledge is best when it's learned not taught. In this program instructors and the learning portal guide the student's learning journey but our students own their learning experience. You'll be assigned to teach your classmates specific topics that are related to concepts and techniques being taught throughout the course and program. This process has been proven to deepen student's understanding, boost retention, and strengthen community and interpersonal communication skills.

  Let's take some time look over the topics and get prepared for them. Next class we'll organized who and when each person is going for each topic.

  [List of Student Daily Presentations](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md){:target="_blank"}

  <!-- TODO in the future - create an site that takes the students names and returns JSON that represents the topics, titles, and students. -->

## Creation Time

By the end of this program you're going to be building a Full-stack application to show to the world you can build web apps. To display that you're going to build a portfolio website where you can collect and showcase each of the apps you build in the future. Today, you're going to begin to build the Landing Page of that portfolio website using CodePen and the example in the page: [Landing Page](../additionalResources/project-LandingPage.md)
