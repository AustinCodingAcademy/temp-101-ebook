In the video below, Andy Puddicombe ingeniously describes the way our minds can go haywire and distract us from the task at hand while causing distress at the same time.

The truth is, it takes less than 10 minutes. Start with 1 second, just breathe and see what arises. Then try again for another second. Breathe in. Breathe out. Imagine letting the thoughts that arise in that 1 second as balloons that drift away without you reaching out for their strings.

When you come back, try for 3 seconds and let those balloons go too. Repeat this a few times. Soon you'll be up to 10 seconds. Then a minute. Then you'll long for 5 minutes.

Soon you'll think 10 minutes isn't long enough. I promise! There are a few meditation apps to help you in this journey but remember, there are no rules. There are no "right ways" to do it. Just watch your own mind and notice how the focus on your breath can slow those thoughts down and deny them energy to grow into anxiety.

Here are some apps to try:

* [Calm](https://www.calm.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/){:target="_blank"}

No matter what your practice looks like, you will see huge benefits in your relationships, your self-motivation, your coding, and your overall mood. Give it a try for the rest of this course and see what you think.
