# Playing with Code in a Sandbox
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

## Overview

In the last class and during your pre-course prep, we used [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) to build projects. Programs like this are referred to as "Code Sandboxes" meaning you can build and play in a secure controlled environment without much setup, overhead, or concern about breaking something. Starting with this next class you're going to move to a new sandbox called [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

Code **sandboxes** are useful tools to share ideas and explore new possibilities â€“ without the pressures of building a **file structure**, setting up your machine, working through on the console, or remembering git commands. For the forseeable future, we'll use [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) to share snippets of code, practice coding, and discover new things. Get in the habit building in CodePen as you work through the textbook; it's "where the rubber meets the road."With them, you can apply the concepts you've learned, and experiment with the technologies at the heart of your future career.

### TODO - Create a CodeSandbox Account

Go ahead a get started by creating a free account with either Google, Apple, or GitHub. Don't worry, there are no charges and there are lots of things you can do with the free account.

In addition to being a cleaner interface, Code Sandbox offers code suggestions and auto-complete which will help you learn faster, code faster, and grow faster!!

## See It - Why Coding Sandboxes

In the video below, Joe (an ACA Alumnus) explains the use of coding sandboxes like CodePen and Repl.it.

## Practice It

1. Create a Code Sandbox Account.
1. Create a new HTML + CSS sandbox:
    ![codeSandbox-createNewSandbox](../images/codeSandbox-createNewSandbox.png)
1. Name the sandbox & make it public:
    ![codeSandbox-NameAndMakePublic](../images/codeSandbox-NameAndMakePublic.png)
1. Transfer your [Portfolio Landing Page](../module-1/class-1.md) from CodePen to CodeSandbox and feel the difference. Notice the code suggestions and auto-complete.
