## Overview

With the exception of the CSS Grid properties you see in the code given to you for your Portfolio Landing Page, you've been working with elements that stack below one another, due to normal document flow. But, as you know, typical websites have multiple elements across the screen and not just stacked on top of one another. This can be done with the value: flex given to the property display of the element we want. Let's dig into that.

Remember that each of the elements in an HTML file have many properties behind them that we can access with CSS and JavaScript(JS). One of these properties is the display property. Through it we can change the way the element is rendered on the screen and how its child elements are arranged within it.
