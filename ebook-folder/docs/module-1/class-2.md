*****

- [ ] Draw a wireframe with HTML tags denoting each element
- [ ] Create a repo on GitHub with a `README.md`
- [ ] `git clone` it to your local machine.
- [ ] Create an `index.html` and `style.css` file and link them together.
- [ ] Using `display: flex;` and the box model, follow the mock-up below to build the NASA landing page.
- [ ] Use [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/) to download an image that is similar to the one on your mockup.
- [ ] Use [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find the font closest to the font on the mockup.
- [ ] Use [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en) to get the right colors.
- [ ] Push your local changes up to your remote repo:
    * [ ] `git status`,
    * [ ] `git add .`,
    * [ ] `git status`,
    * [ ] `git commit -m "your meaningful message"`,
    * [ ] `git push`,

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Use a Form & Input elements to create the form in the mockup.
- [ ] Link your new NASA Page to your Portfolio website by creating a portfolio page in your Portfolio website folder that has a list of links with one of them as: "NASA Contact Page". This way you have 2 hosted pages and one of them links to the other. Go do it! You have the skills now. Get messy and play!!
- [ ] Remember to link your `portfolio.html` file to your `index.html` file in your Portfolio folder and `push` your changes again.
- [ ] Add a [slide show of images](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) to your NASA Contact Page.
- [ ] [Add an Overlay Zoom](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_zoom) to the page.
