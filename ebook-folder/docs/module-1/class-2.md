### Interview Challenge, 30 mins
<!-- The last two E happen here: elaborate and evaluate  -->
<!-- this sections should have a challenge that can be solved with the skills they've learned since their last class. -->

[See Your Challenge Here](./../additionalResources/interviewChallenges.md){:target="_blank"}

Use this mockup to create a wireframe that includes HTML tags to be used as well as CSS properties that need to be used. Work as a class to create a thorough wireframe from each student to use.

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

If the instructor and students both see fit, this assignment may be done in partners but each student must turn in their own work.

- [ ] Go to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/dashboard) and create a new HTML + CSS Sandbox named "NASA Contact Page - Flex Property Practice"
- [ ] Use the wireframe you created during the Interview Challenge section to guide you as you build this page.
- [ ] Remember to use the `display: flex;` property/value and the box model while following the mock-up and your wireframe.
- [ ] Use [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/){:target="_blank"} to download an image that is similar to the one on your mockup.
- [ ] Use [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/){:target="_blank"} to find the font closest to the font on the mockup.
- [ ] Use [ColorPick Eyedropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en){:target="_blank"} to get the right colors.
- [ ] TURN IT IN: Copy/Paste the URL of the CodeSandbox into the assignment slot in your LMS (Learning Management System).

  <!-- TODO Delete > In case you need it, here's a [Follow-Up Video for the NASA Page](https://player.vimeo.com/video/296667713){:target="_blank"} . -->

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Use a Form & Input elements to create the form in the mockup.
- [ ] Link your new NASA Page to your Portfolio website by creating a portfolio page in your Portfolio website folder that has a list of links with one of them as: "NASA Contact Page". This way you have 2 hosted pages and one of them links to the other. Go do it! You have the skills now. Get messy and play!!
- [ ] Remember to link your `portfolio.html` file to your `index.html` file in your Portfolio folder and `push` your changes again.
- [ ] Add a [slide show of images](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp){:target="_blank"} to your NASA Contact Page.
- [ ] [Add an Overlay Zoom](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_zoom){:target="_blank"} to the page.
