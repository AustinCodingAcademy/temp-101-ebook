# Pre-Class Lesson 16: Develop Series, Self Motivation

Look, you started class with us and you trust our program so far. I need you to take that trust and build it upon yourself now. I've seen our graduates get jobs before they graduate, 1 month after, 3 months, and even 10 months after. The difference is in how much they believe in themselves. This very crucial piece is why these "Develop Series" are in your textbookâ€”to help you find that beautiful strength within yourself so you can latch on to it and take yourself wherever you want to go.

Scott Geller has a marvelous understanding of self-motivation that you can use for yourself. Tune in, turn off, and listen.
