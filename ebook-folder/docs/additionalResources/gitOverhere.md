# Managing Versions of Code with Git & GitHub

Remember, in a Flipped Classroom you will study and consume your "lecture" *before* you come to class, so that you can take advantage of your time in class to practice and apply concepts with the guidance of your instructor and support of your classmates. With the guidance of your instructor you will be able to confidently make mistakes, run into errors, and find bugs in your code. But for all of this to happen, you must make sure that you complete your pre-homework before each class.

Let's begin:

On the first day of class we will hosting your the portfolio web page that you'll soon build. To do this, you will need the Git software to move the files from your local machine (*computer*) to a remote repository on GitHub from where it will be hosted live on the internet for anyone that has the URL to see!

### Read It - Git Software

With all software, including the desktop and mobile apps that you use every day, developers are always making changes and updates. Think of all the times you've been asked to update to the latest version of an app on your phone. The reason the company asks you to do this is because the team of developers have fixed bugs, improved efficiency, or add/removed features. These changes are happening all the time, all day long across an entire team of developers but are only released every so often to users. To manage all of these changes, a system called **version control** was developed. Of all the version control softwares available, **Git** is by far the most popular â€“ and it's free!

As you read above, using a version control software like Git is incredibly important as a developer. Version control allows for multiple developers to work on the same codebase at the same time, revert selected files back to a previous state, revert an entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. This helps developers work more efficiently, effectively, and responsibly when editing code.

### Read It - GitHub

**GitHub** is a web application that works with *git*. It is a place we can store code to share with others and collaborate on projects simultaneously or asynchronously. In class and in your job, you will use GitHub every day to:

* store your code online (in the *cloud*)
* host and share your projects in this class
* share your code's Pull Requests (PRs) with your instructor or team
* receive comments on your code from your instructor or team

We're going to start by creating an online account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). After setting up your account we will walk through the steps of downloading the git software and learning a few of its __many__ commands. Before getting started, be aware that Git works in what is called the "Command-Line Interface". You probably won't feel comfortable with this interface __yet__ but you soon will be. I promise!

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account.
1. **Be sure to use a professional name like `firstNameLastName` for your username** It will be the first thing on your resume for potential employers to read!!!!!!
1. **IMPORTANT** Write down your username and password...**We will be using it again soon.**
