# Daily Student Presentations

<!-- Explain the purpose of presentations -->

* **Class 1** - *Teach purpose of presentations and mentally prepare the class.*
* **Class 2** - *Organize and Coordinate who and when students are presenting.*
* **Class 3, 4, and 5** - *33% of the class will properly teach the class about themselves in less than 4 minutes. Include the following as guidelines:*

    - [ ] Who you are (How do you describe your history, experience, and character...)
    - [ ] Your current understanding of life, your work, your hobbies, and your family...
    - [ ] What it is you want to do with the skills you're learning...
    - [ ] What is important to you outside of school, work, family, and hobbies...
    - [ ] And lastly, a problem you currently have/see that you'd like to solve with technology.

* **Class 6** - *25% of the class will teach the class about something they know well in less than 3 minutes. i.e. A special skill, talent or task.*

By the end of this Full-Stack Program you will have the tools to build a mobile app with a server, database, and a front-end app. To prove this to you, your family, and your future employers you will build an app of your design as a Capstone Project upon graduation. Think of it as your thesis for web development.

You have enough experience now to start understanding what can be done and what you'd like to build as your Capstone Project. To get you started think of some task(s) you do often or a current hiccup in your daily routine or a wrinkle in some process you'd like smoothed out. Now start thinking of how this technology could solve those things. This is what you'll build. Make it personal to you so you build it with passion to get you through the tough times and the frustrations that will inevitably come as you build it.

Next class you'll deliver your first [pitch](https://hbr.org/2003/09/how-to-pitch-a-brilliant-idea) of this solution. Think of it as a practice in story-telling to people that are consciously-unaware of the problem knowing that once you present it to them, they will want the solution in their life! Your prompt is as follows..

In less than three mins:

    - [ ] "Have you ever...." present the problem to the class
    - [ ] "But what if we had ...." offer a solution to the problem
    - [ ] "I am building this very ...." commit yourself to the solution
    - [ ] Then be prepared for questions from your classmates and instructor.

**Organize it!!** The instructor will take a few minutes now to divide students up similarly to the way your last round of presentations have been with 3 students presenting each class for the next 6 classes, starting next class.

* **Class 7, 8, and 9** - *25% of the class will teach the class about something they know well in less than 3 minutes. i.e. A special skill, talent or task.*

* **Class 10, 11, and 12** - *33% of the class will pitch your graduation app idea to the class in less than 3 minutes. Whatâ€™s the problem? How does this app solve it?*
