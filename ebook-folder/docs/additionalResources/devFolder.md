## Create Your Development Folder

For sanity and organization sake, you'll want a designated folder to keep all your coding projects together on your computer. This isn't a special folder just one that will be dedicated to keeping up with your future coding projects.

- [ ] Open your terminal/Command-Line/Powershell
- [ ] Run `ls` + ++enter++ to see all of your files and folders.
- [ ] If you don't see "Documents" somewhere in the list you need to run `cd ~` to get to your "User" folder.
- [ ] If you haven't already done made this in a Prep Class, make a new folder named `devFolder`by running: `mkdir devFolder` + ++enter++
- [ ] Change into the new folder/directory you made in the last class: `cd devFolder` + ++enter++

> NOTE FOR WINDOWS MACHINES USING ONEDRIVE:
> If you use OneDrive to save your photos, music, and other files, you may run into problems using Git and GitHub to create and manage your repos. If you have any issues, please refer to [How to Configure OneDrive to Sync Only Certain Folders in Windows 10](https://www.howtogeek.com/222817/how-to-configure-onedrive-to-sync-only-certain-folders-in-windows-10/){:target="_blank"} to unsync your `devFolder`.

*You will only need to create one folder for all of your coding projects to be stored in for the entirety of the program. When you graduate and get a job you will want to create a new folder to organize that work in.*
