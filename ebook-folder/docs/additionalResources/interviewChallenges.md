# Interview Challenges

## Why Train for Interviews?

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor):

## How to Solve Your Challenge

- [ ] Restate the question aloud.
- [ ] Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Ask any clarifying questions you need.
- [ ] Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up.
Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard.
Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!
- [ ] Build the structure of your function(s).
- [ ] Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need.
- [ ] Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud.
- [ ] It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution!
- [ ] After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home.
