# Interview Challenges

## Why Train for Interviews?

Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare you for the challenges ahead we will practice whiteboarding in front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The whiteboarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor):

## How to Solve Your Challenge

- [ ] Restate the question aloud.
- [ ] Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard.
- [ ] Ask any clarifying questions you need.
- [ ] Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up.
Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard.
Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!
- [ ] Build the structure of your function(s).
- [ ] Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need.
- [ ] Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud.
- [ ] It's not about finding the solution. It's about collaborating and working toward a solution!
- [ ] After you finish, take a picture and transfer it to a Repl.it when you get home.

## The Prompts

### Class 1

**NONE**

### Class 2

**Wireframe & Plan** - *What is wireframing? How do we plan the construction of a web page? How can we use paper and pencil to guide us while coding? As a class, talk through and develop a plan to build the NASA Contact Page.*
<!-- - [ ] **Prompt 2: Title** - *description* -->

### Class 3

**Title** - *Two students, at-a-time, will come up to the board at a time to work with their instructor to wireframe the following website mockups:*

  > NOTE: please use the time to create meaningful wireframes with semantic elements and maybe useful CSS pseudo code that can guide your coding for today's project.

### Class 4

**Title** - *Two students at a time will come up to the board to work with their instructor to wireframe each of the the three [website](https://www.sodgod.com/composting/) mockups below. 3 views = 6 students total.*

=== "Mobile View"

### Class 5

**Title** - *Two students(6 total) will come up to the board at a time to work with their instructor to wireframe each of the the three mockups from the [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/co2-levels-just-hit-another-record-heres-why-it-matters/). While the students work at the board, the rest of the class should be following along with pencil and paper at their own desks.*

### Class 6

**Title** - *Wireframe the Image Gallery Mockup below. How do you get the text to appear when the user's cursor is over the top of it?*

![image-gallery-wireframing-challenge](./../images/image-gallery-wireframing-challenge.png)

### Class 7

**Code Plan** - *As a class, what problem do we need to solve in the Calculator App? How do we solve it? Let's create a list of actions we need to take to complete it.*
<!-- - [ ] **Prompt 2: Title** - *description* -->

### Class 8

*Using one of the website examples below, the instructor will lead a discussion and demonstration about breaking down this large project into smaller manageable pieces so you can finish it before the due date next week.*

2. [https://freewebsitetemplates.com/preview/mustacheenthusiast/contact.html](https://freewebsitetemplates.com/preview/mustacheenthusiast/contact.html)

> Remember, this is your first BIG project. You're now learning how to break big problems in to smaller pieces: websites into web pages, web pages into web elements, web elements into element properties. This is how you develop a plan.

### Class 9

- [ ] **Prompt 1: Fizz Buzz** - Today we'll switch our interview training to something a little different, programming. This will take a slightly different form than what we've seen before but it a very nice introduction to what some of your future interviews will look like.

Your instructor will lead this exercise, writing on the board only what you tell them to write. Before you begin you might need to know a few things:

1. FizzBuzz is a right-of-passage in the software development world. It's like the "Hello World" of programming. It goes like this:

    * [ ] Create a function that lists all numbers between 1 - 1000;
    * [ ] but instead of printing the numbers that are evenly divisible by 3, print `"fizz"`;
    * [ ] and instead of printing the numbers that are evenly divisible by 5, print `"buzz"`;
    * [ ] also, if the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"fizzBuzz"`.

2. You'll need a few things from your past pre-lessons:

    * [ ] `%` modulus
    * [ ] `while` loop
    * [ ] `++` incrementor
    * [ ] **And something you have covered in depth yet:** `if(){} if else(){} else {}`

    > NOTE: Take some time to think about the logic of the solution before you begin, but begin soon!

3. Test it by putting it into a computer.
4. Any questions?

### Class 10

- [ ] **Prompt 1: Rotate** - *Write a function named `rotateArray` that rotates the elements of an array. All elements should be moved one position to the left. The 0th element should be placed at the end of the array. The rotated array should be returned.*

Example: `rotate(['a', 'b', 'c'])` should return `['b', 'c', 'a']`.
<!-- - [ ] **Prompt 2: Title** - *description* -->

### Class 11

- [ ] **Prompt 1: isGreaterThanFifty** - *Write a JavaScript program to check two given numbers and return true if one of the numbers is 50 or if their sum is 50.*

```javascript
// Example input and expected output

checkSum(50, 12) // => true
checkSum(10, 11) // => false
checkSum(26, 24) // => true
checkSum(49, 2) // => false 
```
