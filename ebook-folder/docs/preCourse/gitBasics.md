# Git Basics

## Overview

Git is usually a hard concept for new programmers to wrap their minds around. Don't worry, you will get Git by the end of this course â€“ if not by the end of this week. But to make sure you understand it sooner, let's go over some basic concepts and commands.

Be sure to write down all of your questions, thoughts, and epiphanies to bring into class for healthy discussion and discovery!
