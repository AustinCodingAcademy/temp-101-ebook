Many benefits spring from starting your own blog! To enumerate a few:

* establishing and building-up your online presence
* reflecting on your own learning and engraining the value
* sharing and connecting with others
* contributing your lessons to the community
* expressing yourself and recording your thoughts in a place you can easily return or share with others (i.e. potential employers)

In class, we will use your blog for all of these reasons. Your blog will allow you to record your thoughts and lessons, share them with your instructor, and **prepare for the rigors of developer interviews to come**.

## Read It

<!-- Give them our writing of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Navigating this web-based textbook will enhance your skills and knowledge, but we can't cover everything you might face in interviews. Each lesson ends with "Interview Questions" to explore deeper topics beyond coding and presentation skills. If these questions stump you, greatâ€”that's your cue to learn. You're graded on weekly blog posts addressing these questions. Research the terms, synthesize your findings, and share in your blog.

Weekly blogging boosts your ability to articulate ideas, preparing you for coding interviews by expanding your understanding of various challenges and solutions. This habit not only serves as a personal study guide but is also crucial for passing the Exit Test of this course, as test questions are drawn from these weekly Interview Questions. Blogging benefits you in multiple ways, ensuring continuous learning and progress.

## Practice It

1. Go to Medium.com
1. Sign-up for a free account
1. Bookmark the site into your bookmarks bar
1. At the end of each class there is a set of *Interview Questions* for you to answer in your blog. Use the time in class to discuss the questions with your instructor but then take them home and research for yourself so you can answer them in your blog.
1. Remember, you will be graded for the completion of your blog but also this will be a place you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months!
1. **When publishing your blogs, make sure you "@LubbockCodingAcademy", "@AustinCodingAcademy", and tag "Coding", and "Web Development" in your story.** This way we can find your blogs easily and feature them if they stand out. This, of course, is also how you build-up your web presence!
