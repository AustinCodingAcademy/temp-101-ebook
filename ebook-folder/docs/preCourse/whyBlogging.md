Many benefits spring from starting your own blog! To enumerate a few:

* establishing and building-up your online presence
* reflecting on your own learning and engraining the value
* sharing and connecting with others
* contributing your lessons to the community
* expressing yourself and recording your thoughts in a place you can easily return or share with others (i.e. potential employers)

In class, we will use your blog for all of these reasons. Your blog will allow you to record your thoughts and lessons, share them with your instructor, and **prepare for the rigors of developer interviews to come**.

## Read It

<!-- Give them our writing of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Progressing through the material and challenges set forth in this web-based textbook will certainly teach you new skills and establish a great baseline of knowledge. However, in our limited time together we cannot cover all of the material that may come up in an interview.

To ensure you are constantly improving upon your skills and knowledge base as a whole, at the end of each lesson there will be a set of questions entitled: *Interview Questions*. The purpose of these questions is to provide you with questions pertaining to deeper topics that might not have been covered while learning the hard-skills of coding and programming or the soft-skills of presenting.

If you don't know the answers to these questions...PERFECT! This is your chance to learn them! You are expected and will be graded each week on your blog post that answers these questions. Use google. Search for the terms in the questions and read as much as you can find. Once you understand the terms and ideas, synthesize the answers to the questions in your weekly blog.

The practice of blogging every week will do countless things for you. Simply covering new material, pushing your upper-limits and converting your new ideas into words will cultivate your ability to speak about them, which will prepare you to speak about code in interviews. It will slowly yet rapidly build your knowledge of different challenges and solutions-based approaches and record them in a place for you to return to when you are preparing for interviews as a study guide...in your own words!!

The final reason you should be happy to be writing a weekly blog is that in order for you to move on to the next course you will need to pass the Exit Test of this course. The questions to this test are pulled from the *Interview Questions* you answer each week. This is a win-win for you all the way around!

## Practice It

1. Go to Medium.com
1. Sign-up for a free account
1. Bookmark the site into your bookmarks bar
1. At the end of each class there is a set of *Interview Questions* for you to answer in your blog. Use the time in class to discuss the questions with your instructor but then take them home and research for yourself so you can answer them in your blog.
1. Remember, you will be graded for the completion of your blog but also this will be a place you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months!
1. **When publishing your blogs, make sure you "@LubbockCodingAcademy", "@AustinCodingAcademy", and tag "Coding", and "Web Development" in your story.** This way we can find your blogs easily and feature them if they stand out. This, of course, is also how you build-up your web presence!
