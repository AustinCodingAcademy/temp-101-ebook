As you move along through this course, we will be giving you many topics for you to learn about that might not seems like they relate to one another. The reason for this is that there are so many technologies to learn, so many specialities, so many areas for you to learn and catch up with. They won't all make sense or seem as if they have direct connection to what you're working on but I encourage you to ask more, find articles and videos that help you understand each of these suggested topics on a deeper level.

We develop our curriculum, textbooks, classroom culture, and teaching style based on industry standards. One of those standards is overlapping specialities. A Full-Stack developer not only needs to code but also to plan for **Search Engine Optimization** and build for **Accessibility**.

Obviously, you will not know everything about everything upon graduations but if you take judicious and copious notes, as your progress you will have a strong map to guide you through any challenge and approach any problem.

Let's start one of this list of funny/estranged topics with **Accessibility**. Before you jump into this, you should know that most developers are hired for specific skills and this skill is in **high** demand!

The great thing about accessible design is that it doesn't hinder anyone, but rather helps you reach more people with your product with even more ease. Just as the **Americans with Disability Act** addresses the accessibility of everyday physical services to all, it also covers web content. All companies want our designs to reach everyone equally not only because the law requires but because it the the right thing to do! As you build each project in the course consider how accessible it is to users that experience impairments. Check out the articles below to better understand why, what, and how you can implement these changes in your product.

<!-- [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) concerns itself not only with making websites beautiful, but providing a structured approach to designing practical, universally intuitive user interaction. The keyword here is *'universally'*; one important consideration UX designers account for is **accessibility** - particularly **colorblindness**. A particular company's website might look fantastic, but a problematic color scheme could effectively alienate a significant percentage of potential viewers - about [**8% of all men, and about 1% of all women**.](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/) -->
