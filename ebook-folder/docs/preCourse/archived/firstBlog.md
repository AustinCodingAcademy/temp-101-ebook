After you've finished building your portfolio's landing page write your **first blog post** on Medium. Remember creating a blog and posting regularly is a great way to start building your web presence â€“ something that will help you immensely once you begin looking for a job in this field and grow your career after getting your first web dev role.

Remember, these assignments, the **Portfolio Landing Page** and **Blog**, are for you to do on your own **before** your first day of class. You may have questions or feel like what you're creating isn't perfect or polished, but that's ok. We'll work together to fix it, host it, and make changes to it in class on Day 1. Your instructor will also walk you through where and how to turn in two assignments to be graded.

## Blog to Show You Know Interview Questions

*Every other class will end with a discussion over a set of questions like the ones you see below. If you have no idea how to answer thw questions, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on **your own** and record what you learned in a blog using Medium. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Campus Manager. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge, deepen your understanding, and get you thinking about these concepts the way programmers think about them. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!*

**We can't make you do anything. We can only suggest to you what you should and can do. It will be up to you to make it happen!**

**Important!**

1. You will be graded for the completion of your blog. But it will also serve as a place that you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months!
1. **When publishing your blogs, make sure you "@AustinCodingAcademy", and tag "Coding", and "Web Development" in your story.**
1. You'll turn in Class One Blog on your first day of class.
1. Remember, the title of your blog doesn't have to be "BlogPost_100". Instead, name it something personal, something that matches your current experience like: "Dazed and Confused", "Wonderful Fun in Code Land", etc.
