# Playing with code in a sandbox!
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

## Overview

## Read It - Code Sandboxes
<!-- Give them our writing of the subject then link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... that help give more perspective on the subject  -->
Code **sandboxes** are useful tools to share ideas and explore new possibilities â€“ without the pressures of building a **file structure**, setting up your machine, or depending on the console. In class, we'll use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) to share snippets of code, practice coding, and discover new things. Get in the habit of browsing and playing with CodePens as you work through the textbook; it's "where the rubber meets the road." With them, you can apply the concepts you've learned, and experiment with the technologies at the heart of your future career.
