## Read It - Focus of 101

All of the websites, web apps and mobile apps you use on a daily basis are built with three languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three languages make up every bit of content delivered to you via the internet. Why? Because they are the only languages web browsers can read.

In this class, you'll be learning how to use these languages to make the layout and design of what you see on your computer's screen when you request a page on the internet. We will focus our 101 exploration on the "front-end" of the internet; which is to say the pretty graphics, buttons, forms, pictures, text, and animations you see on any webpage you've ever visited. As you progress through the program to graduation you will learn more and more about the "back-end" which includes the database and server that provide the content/data that the "front-end" consumes, manipulates, and displays to the user in a human-friendly way.

During the 101 Course you should focus your time on understanding:

- [ ] The **DOM**, which is the fundamental structure underneath every web page. This will never change. The DOM is your coding road map. If you understand the DOM you can navigate any web page's codebase and fix any problem.

- [ ] **Accessibility**. Just like ramps, elevators, and braille are required for buildings, they are also required for websites. When you build your Capstone Project in 411 you should have a good grasp of 508 Accessibility Compliance – not only so everyone can use your app, but so you can get hired! [Large companies get sued for violations of this](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hotels-ada-compliance-20181111-story.html), all the time!!

- [ ] Understanding of **Element Selectors** and using element names, (`class`, pseudo`:` and `id`), as they pertain to CSS and JS, to access and manipulate the DOM. You'll develop a more in-depth understanding of these concepts in time, but know that learning them is going to be a key part of this course.

- [ ] **Git Software** and its commands. **No matter where you work you will use git in the command-line.** Yes, it is unfamiliar and can be an uncomfortable thing to learn, but it is crucial to you becoming a successful web developer. During this course, we'll focus primarily on the purpose and way to use these five key commands: `git status`, `git add`, `git commit - m " "`, `git push`, and `git pull`. With an understanding of these commands, you'll be able to navigate and understand how to use other commands as you need them.

- [ ] **Learning on Your Own**. Once you graduate and go on to become a professional developer you will be paid to solve problems that haven't been solved before. Therefore, you must be comfortable with the unknown, with asking questions and finding answers, with the idea of, "I don't know... yet". Every time you come across a word, element, or line of code you don't know – look it up. Ask. Figure out how to type good questions into Google and skim the search results. This is half of what you need to learn in the program.

What you don't need to worry about:

**Designing**! Unless you have a print or art background, **DON'T** frustrate yourself over creating a beautiful layout! Instead, focus on grasping the underlying concepts first. Even as a front-end developer at many companies, you'll lean on the expertise of designers to provide you with a framework. As you learn these concepts, trying to make sure that every project you build is a visual masterpiece can be overwhelming. So give yourself a break for not building a web page as beautiful as Instagram or Spotify in your first 8 weeks.

### Wrapping Up

You are going to be learning a lot in the next 8 weeks – maybe more than you've learned in a while! But, rest assured that this method works. Many, many graduates have sat where you are right now and through hard work and dedication have gained full-time employment that provides them meaning in their work, a competitive salary capable of providing a good living standard for their families, and the freedom to grow and explore in new directions.

Trust yourself. Trust the process. And, above all, **always do your Pre-Class Lessons**.
