Learning in a differently styled classroom than the one you're used to can be a hard adjustment for some. Here you can learn what adjustments you'll need to make in your mind about a [Flipped Classroom](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/flipped-learning-0) approach.

In the traditional classroom, the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school.

In a Flipped Classroom students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions over the content, small discussions of related topics, and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, while grappling with coding challenges.

This approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven effective and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education.

### Practice It

1. Read, watch, and do each Pre-class Lesson before its corresponding class and write down your questions and thoughts. Bring them to class. The more you do this the better you will work in class and the faster you will learn.
