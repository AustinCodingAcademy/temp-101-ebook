# The S.A.T. Method

## Overview

As you begin your journey into web development, you will learn you have dedicated yourself to a lifetime of learning. All developers, all day, are researching and learning about new technologies and better solutions to their problems. You are on track to join them in this exploration. There is an ever-growing wealth of knowledge online. Because of the massive landscape of development and our limited time together, you must bring a sense of **ownership** to this class. This is what we mean by a **growth-mindset**.

You must own your learning, your growth, and your curiosity. To help you do this, we will not only be teaching you how to code, program, and develop, but also how to learn and teach yourself new skills to expand your abilities. One of the many skills that will help you grow is Googling. It may sound funny, but *Googling* really is one of the most powerful skills you can nurture.

## Search. Ask. Teach.

**S.A.T.** is an acronym for our style of passing on, maintaining, and growing in-house knowledge in our ACA family, which also contributes to our online and in-class community and culture: make yourself better every day while making others around you better!

It works like this:

If you have a question, you should immediately ask yourself: “Is it in my textbook?"

**1. SEARCH** for the question using your resources,

…if you don’t find what you’re asking for:

**2. ASK** your question to your classmates and/or instructor,

your learning community is a great resource to pull from and contribute to...

**3. TEACH** the solution.

This is the most important part. If you know the answer to a posted question, then go and answer it! Also, if you learn something new, pass it on to others.

Final Thoughts
Don’t underestimate the power of sharing what you know. It always comes back around!
