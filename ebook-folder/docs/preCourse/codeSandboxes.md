# Playing with code in a sandbox!
<!-- This is how each subject should be introduced. Give the students structure so they know they can start trusting the process sooner!  -->

## Overview

In the last class, we used [Codepen.io](http://codepen.io/) to build our first project.  Programs like this are referred to as "Code Sandboxes".  We tried it out as a guest user, but there are benefits to creating a free account, including being able to save your work.

Code **sandboxes** are useful tools to share ideas and explore new possibilities â€“ without the pressures of building a **file structure**, setting up your machine, or depending on the console. In class, we'll use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) to share snippets of code, practice coding, and discover new things. Get in the habit of browsing and playing with CodePens as you work through the textbook; it's "where the rubber meets the road." With them, you can apply the concepts you've learned, and experiment with the technologies at the heart of your future career.
