## Read It

This textbook integrates **overview videos** and **detailed "Read It" sections** to cater to diverse learning styles, enhancing understanding and importance of content for all. It employs [Differentiated Learning](https://www.weareteachers.com/what-is-differentiated-instruction/), utilizing varied mediums like videos, readings, and hands-on coding to stimulate different brain regions, fostering pattern recognition and personal insights. The course encourages active participation through **"Practice It"** and **"Know Your Docs"** sections for deeper understanding. Emphasis is placed on practicing problems independently for satisfaction and confidence building. Instead of traditional lectures, instructors facilitate learning through challenges, requiring completion of pre-homework for effective class engagement. This approach supports part-time learning alongside full-time employment, emphasizing the need for self-study beyond the classroom to maximize learning outcomes.

Why? Our instructors don’t *lecture* in class. Instead, our instructors guide you through multiple challenges including logic problems, presentations, interview questions, and application programming challenges. To use the class time effectively you and all of your classmates must complete the assigned pre-homework.

If you and your classmates do this you’ll be able to get into class and really ask good questions, apply what you’re learning at home and advance your skills more quickly. This program is built to accommodate full-time workers through part-time classes **BUT** you will not learn everything you need to learn in these 5 hours/week. **YOU MUST READ, WATCH, PRACTICE, and RESEARCH** on your own. 

Each of the sections in your pre-lesson homeworks have been honed in through years of training student-developers to focus on what they really need to learn in a very short amount of time. Trust the process, do the work, sacrifice time now for your future, and [GSD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GSD)!

## Flipped Classroom

**TL;DR** You read & study **outside of class** and apply that knowledge **in class** with the support of your classmates and instructor. No pride. No ego. No shame.

[A more academic definition can be found here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/flipped-learning). But the following videos do well to explain it well. Either way, this approach works and works well! The only challenge now is to shape your mindset around it.

### Read It - Why

In the **traditional classroom**, the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school.

In a **flipped classroom** students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and playing with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions over the content, small discussions of related topics and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, during problems and struggles.

This approach may feel difficult/odd at first but the theory & methodology have been proven to work and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education...A.K.A. You!

### Practice It - How

**WATCH, READ, PRACTICE, RESEARCH, AND WRITE**

Every Pre-Homework will have a video to **See It**. These videos are incredibly important to help build context for why you’ll be learning the upcoming concept. Watch all videos that are given to you even if they’re 30 mins, 60 mins or just 5 mins. Watch them all! They were built or chosen because they teach what we need you to learn.

Your lessons will include other sections that are just as important:

* **Read It**: Ensure you understand all pre-homework by reading every suggested article, vital for grasping complex or technical concepts.

* **Practice It**: Engage with Practice It sections to apply and truly learn the material. Use tools like Repl.it for exercises, and persist until full comprehension is achieved.

* **Know Your Docs**: Utilize (1)the internet, (2)documentation, and (3)the [AI Tutor](https://chatbottutor-7e7843ea9900.herokuapp.com/), (4)your classmates, (5)a tutor, (6)your instructor for all "bugs" or questions as you build.

* **Blog to Show You Know**: Regularly write blog posts about your learning journey, using the provided prompts or use your own thoughts thoughts. This prepares you for job interviews by reflecting on questions derived from past graduate interviews and research.
