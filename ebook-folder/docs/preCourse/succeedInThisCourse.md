## Read It

Every section in this textbook consists of an overview video that is designed to help you understand what you're about to learn and why it's important. After watching the video you'll also have a **Read It*" section (like this one) that will provide more context and detail. We all learn in different ways but we also learn in similar ways. Video might be better for some while reading is better for others, however, the reinforcement from both angles is ideal for all.

Throughout this course, you will be consuming your work through a variety of different mediums – reading, videos, hands-on coding platforms, and more. This approach is part of a well-documented and successful teaching and learning strategy called [Differentiated Learning](https://www.weareteachers.com/what-is-differentiated-instruction/), whereby we active different regions of your brain to help you notice patterns and build your own understandings. Take the time with each "Read It" and "Know Your Docs" section to build your understanding, draw conclusions, and take notes of what you've realized.

Following these sections will usually be another video – **See It** – that dives into the application of the concept and then a **Practice It** section that gives you the opportunity to tinker with the concept in a hands-on way.

Please, *please*, **please**, practice the problems during your homework. Teach yourself to approach a problem and figure it out yourself. You will gain so much satisfaction, confidence, and gainful understanding if you apply your mind to each and every problem!

Why? Our instructors don’t lecture in class. Instead, our instructors guide you through multiple challenges including logic problems, presentations, interview questions, and application programming challenges. To use the class time effectively you and all of your classmates must complete the assigned pre-homework.

If you and your classmates do this you’ll be able to get into class and really ask good questions, apply what you’re learning at home and advance your skills more quickly. This program is built to accommodate full-time employment through part-time classes BUT you will not learn everything you need to learn in these 5 hours/week. *YOU MUST READ, WATCH, PRACTICE, and RESEARCH* on your own. Each of the sections in your pre-lesson homeworks have been honed in through years of training student-developers to focus on what they really need to learn in a very short amount of time. Trust the process, do the work, sacrifice time now for your future, and [GSD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GSD)!

## Flipped Classroom: What

The short? You read and study **outside of class** and apply that knowledge **in class** with the support of your classmates and instructor. No pride. No ego. No shame.

[A more academic definition can be found here](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/flipped-learning). But the following videos do well to explain it well. Either way, this approach works and works well! The only challenge now is to shape your mindset around it.

### The Flipped Classroom: Why

In the **traditional classroom**, the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school.

In a **flipped classroom** students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions over the content, small discussions of related topics and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, during problems and struggles.

This approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven to work and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education.

### The Flipped Classroom: How

**WATCH, READ, PRACTICE, RESEARCH, AND WRITE**

Every Pre-Homework will have a video to WATCH. These videos are incredibly important to help build context for why you’ll be learning the upcoming concept. Watch all videos that are given to you even if they’re 30 mins, 60 mins or just 5 mins. Watch them all! They were built or chosen because they teach what we need you to learn.

**READ ALL** of the pre-homework given to you. Each lesson has been carefully thought out and crafted to guide you through, sometimes, very complex or technically intricate processes. Make sure you understand the concepts by reading every article that’s suggested.

**PRACTICE** Most pre-homework will have Practice It sections where you can apply the lesson you’ve just watched and read about. This section is where you actually learn! Don’t cut yourself short. **DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEM**! Put it in a Repl.it and don’t stop fidgeting with it until you completely understand it.

**RESEARCH** your questions! ALL questions can be answered on the internet. Don’t wait until you get to class to answer low hanging fruit. Find it on the internet. Then you can use your class time to ask harder questions with deeper understanding. At the end of most pre-lesson homeworks you’ll see a list of **Terms to Know & Questions for Discussion**. If you can’t describe or answer them to another person you need to go look them up on Google, read or watch a video on them, then **WRITE** down your understanding of each one in your journal.

**WRITE** your blogging questions every week. You’ll see a lesson on creating your blog account on Medium.com in the Pre-Course Lessons, so you can publish your thoughts on multiple subjects. These questions are collected from various interviews from our graduates and online research to **prepare you for the hardest interview you’ve ever experienced**, the one you’ll go through for your first developer job.
