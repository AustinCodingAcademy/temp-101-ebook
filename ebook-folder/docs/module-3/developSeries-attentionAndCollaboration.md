# Collaborators over Competitors. Paying Attention over Getting Attention.

For most of us, the world seems set up in a certain way. I am me and everyone else is they. I must survive, thrive, fight, and defend against they. They are against me and anyone that tries to help me is deceitful and manipulative. But why is this? Why do we strike out on the road of our life thinking every weary traveler we meet will somehow have been plotting against us even before we met them? Why is it that we think we must dominant and subdue those that are outside of us. Obviously, this doesn't mean physical domination but more of a mental, emotional, and financial domination. WE typically see others as a person that can give us money or take money from us. WE see others as a thing that can give us undying love and comfort. WE see others as competitive force that we must conquer. But what if it wasn't this way at all?

What if actually the world is filled with a community of members that haven't spoken yet? That haven't dreamed together yet? They haven't communed together yet?

In the TedTalk below, Joseph Gordon-Levitt speaks openly and honestly about the traps we fall into while seeking creative attention. There are trials we all face and pitfall we all will make but knowing about them will give us the opportunity to pick ourselves up when we fall into traps.
