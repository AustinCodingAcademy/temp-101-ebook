# Develop Series: Curing Imposter Syndrome

You might have heard of this at some point in your life and maybe you don't/didn't believe in it. Maybe you are skeptical and think that everything that we can accomplish is what is directly available to us. I hope to help you change that. I hope to guide you to finding that really and truly, the mind manifests sickness in the body as much as it manifests growth, change, and ability in the body. Think of the body as this *gooey robot-avatar* thing and the mind is the OS or **Operating System** of this *gooey robot-avatar* thing. It can be updated, reprogrammed, and optimized to run the body more efficiently. Truly!

See how [Dr. Alia Crum](https://mbl.stanford.edu/people) describes and PROVES it!!

## You're Not an Imposter

As you make the transition from your past job to a career in this new and challenging field, you may at times doubt your ability to do the work â€” solving problems with software. This is normal; these doubts trouble or even plague people at the every-level of experience. (*If you never feel this way you're one of very few lucky ones.*) If you're not one of the lucky ones...read on.

Look, right now you're learning a skill that you might have zero familiarity with. It requires a different, programmatic way of thinking and you might **subconsciously** believe you don't deserve good pay and a healthy creative work environment. Maybe you're allowing past experiences to shape your experience with learning to code. That's okay, forgive yourself and recognize that almost all of our students struggle with [Imposter Syndrome](https://www.fastcompany.com/40421352/the-five-types-of-impostor-syndrome-and-how-to-beat-them). It's a real thing and people struggle with it even after they're hired!!

In the talk below, Lou Solomon discusses how she first learned that anxiety, perfectionism, fear of failure, and self-doubt are the triggers and symptoms of Imposter Syndrome but moreover, she discusses why it's important to overcome this negative self-image and **HOW** she works on it everyday for herself.

You're not an imposter. You're not in-over-your-head. And you're not a failure. And you're not a finished product! You're a human that is constantly being shaped, changed, improved, and currently learning something new and that always comes with challenges. Breathe, give yourself a break and later, when you need a reminder read this article on [How To Deal with Imposter Syndrome](http://time.com/5312483/how-to-deal-with-impostor-syndrome/).

### Imposter Action Item

- [ ] Post to @all in RocketChat that you are not an imposter. Go! Do it now!
- [ ] Find a place to write down for yourself this short message: "I have not learned everything I need, yet!"
- [ ] Place that message where you will see it every day for the rest of your time in code school. Maybe the bathroom mirror....

## Find a Podcast

Lastly, find a podcast to help you learn to code. A survey unveiled a staggering figure: [74% of Coding Students don't listen to podcasts to learn to code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-15-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-4104e29b2781/?source=featured---#2b47)!

Don't be one of those students! Instead, take a look at a few of the podcasts below and begin listening to them in your car. Replace your radio noise with people talking about the thing you want to get good at and get paid to do! Try it out and let us know what you find.

- [ ] [ShopTalk](https://shoptalkshow.com/) is probably the easiest podcast to get into. It focuses on Front-End development and involves listeners by answering their questions. If some of the things don't make sense when you first start, stick with it for a little while trying to figure it out. In this moment you're also learning to piece together information on your own. You're just learning a skill you didn't realize you actually needed.

- [ ] [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/) is a great place to get encouragement and perspective. SOOOO many people, like you, have and are switching careers. Listening to their stories will help create a sense of place, purpose, and direction for you. Remember, you are part of a community whether you know it or not. Start listening to that community so you can benefit from knowing you're part of the community!

There are plenty of other Web Development podcasts to follow and listen to but I recommend these two mentioned above first. As you mature as a web developer you will find yourself looking for more challenging topics and ideas to consider which you can find on [other podcasts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-best-podcasts-for-new-coders-and-the-best-tools-for-listening-to-them-df393b1c8dc/).
