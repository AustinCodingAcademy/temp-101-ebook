# Build Your Network

I don't like the term networking. It makes connection sound phony and cheap. Instead I like to think of it as building my network. Above you learned that we're all connected in more ways than we can imagine. So when you're talking to people truly reach out to them. Care for them. Practice genuine curiosity in them and I promise you won't have a hard time talk with people.

## Join a Meetup

This is the part of the course we'd suggest our students to begin attending a meetup. Obviously in the current pandemic we can't do that. For now, read about why you should plan to attend them in the future and set a reminder on your calendar in a few months to look for a meetup of interest. Meetups are a wonderful way to meet people with interests similar to yours. At [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), you can find reasons to get out of the house and talk to new people every day. Use this to your advantage, and meet other developers, coding students, and recruiters!

Remember, this industry is so new, and so full of people tired of the typical corporate world, that it naturally invites "n00bs." The majority of people who work for tech companies are friendly, and willing to share their experience and knowledge to bring everyone around them up.
