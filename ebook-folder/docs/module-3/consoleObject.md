# The Console Object

*“Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragement – and we will make the goal. “ –Jerome Fleishman*

## Practice It

- [ ] Fork & Clone the [101-ConsoleIntro Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/101-ConsoleIntro).
- [ ] Open it in your text editor and use Live-Server to open it in your browser.
- [ ] Open the Inspector Tools and find the Console Tab
- [ ] Back in your text editor, go to the README file and work through the 5 challenges.

## Working with the Console

If you practiced in the Try It Yourself section above you got used to writing the `console.log()` statement which will be the most prevalent command you'll use in the console.

But moving forward, it's important to remember that the Console, like each of the HTML Elements, is just another object-thing that has properties and methods you can set and call when you need. We'll not cover them all but here are the common ones to remember:

* `log()` - Outputs a message to the console
* `assert()` - Takes two arguments. The first is a callback function and the second is a condition to be compared to.
* `warn()` - Writes a warning message labeled in yellow; .err() writes in red
* `clear()` - Clears the console
* `count()` - Logs the number of times that this particular call to count() has been called
* `time()` - Starts a timer (can track how long an operation takes)

Take each of these methods into the repo you just cloned and write them throughout the code.

* Use `count` inside one of the functions that's called when you click a button.
* Use `time` at the top of each of those functions to time how long they take to execute.
* Add a button into your `html` file that calls the `clear()` method to wipe your console.
* Don't worry about `assert` you can use that in your projects in class if you like.
