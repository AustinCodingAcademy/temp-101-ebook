Look, planning is everything to success! Think back on any project you've ever worked on. Did you find it hard to motivate yourself while you didn't know what to do? Did you struggle to figure out the next step? Or did you know where you were headed and were able to step through each challenge as the came?

In either case, I hope you're able to see right now that having a general plan with large tasks broken into small steps will help you stay focused one step at a time that will accumulate to create one large achievement. I like to remind student's: "Rome was not built in a day, and neither was Google." All of these websites, apps, and services we know as pillars in our society now were, at one point in time, nothing, and all of them were built slowly, step at a time, within an overarching vision/plan.

We're introducing planning here because in the following two weeks you'll be building a new portfolio project with a partner. This additional developer will introduce new challenges for you and them that you'll need to overcome if you want to work in this industry, so let's figure it out!

## Breaking it Down

Remember, a **website** is many **web pages** linked together through **anchor** tags. (*Gives you a pause to think why they were named Anchor Tags...*) In this way, we can begin breaking down the massive tasks of building a website into the pages.

### Practice It - What are the Needs?

- [ ] Go get your notepad and pencil.

  Your final project for this class will be a rebuild of your portfolio website that includes:

  - A Landing page
  - An About page
  - A Resume page
  - A Contact Me page
  - An image gallery, so to speak, that will serve as your Portfolio Page. It will have thumbnails of all the websites you've built and hosted up to this point, that when clicked they will take you to those websites.

- [ ] Write those pages down on 5 different pages as the header for each page.

- [ ] Now begin with your landing page. What does it need? And what would you like to have on it. List those on the page for the Landing Page.
- [ ] Now think about what websites you've built and which of them will be displayed on your Portfolio Page. How would you like it to look and what does the page need to have on it? Write and draw those on the page for Portfolio Page.
- [ ] Resume this for your Resume Page. Write down the needed information and elements. Sketch it out if you have an idea of how it looks right now.
- [ ] And do the same for your About Page and for your Contact Me Form.

*Finish the steps above before continuing.*

### Practice It - How Are Those Needs Expressed?

We're going to get to looking at examples of Portfolio websites but right now I want you to know what you want. Be in touch with that so that you're not corrupted by someone else's vision before you know what you want; what you're capable of creating.

Remember, we're not dealing with code here, we're planning out what the website should look like, what the feel of it is, how it represents you.

- [ ] Close your eyes and think of all 5 pages laid out in-front of you. How do you see them? What do they look like? what shapes do you see? What flow do you see?

  > With each of these steps you should pause, close your eyes and think about them. Remember, this is the discovery of your creativity which you and everyone else has. It just takes space & time to see it. Give yourself that space & time now.

- [ ] Starting from your Landing page, where do you want the user to look to find your Portfolio? How do the thumbnails appear? Are they popping up with animations? Fading in? Sliding in? How does your web page feel?

- [ ] Once a user likes what they see how do they find your Resume? Contact Page?
- [ ] Once you're website has been sent from the recruiter to the hiring manager how do you want your Blog/About page to appear?
- [ ] Draw, however you can, sketch and find a way to capture what you see in your mind! Go!!

### Practice It - Getting Inspiration

Now that you've envisioned what you want to represent you:

- [ ] Google search "web developer portfolio websites". Look through the results and see what you come up with.
- [ ] Write down and keep up with the URLs of the website you like or have elements you'd like to mimic.
- [ ] With each URL, write down what you like about them so you're ready to talk to your coding buddy about what you want to build together. We'll talk about wireframing later.

## Summary

If you spent time with the steps above you see that planning is really taking large tasks and breaking them into smaller more manageable steps. You see, our minds have a finite amount of focus space. We can use that focus space to see the grand view or we can use it to focus on the details that make up that grand view, but we can't do both at the same time. Because of this, we have to learn to switch our minds focus from grand to small, then to grand and back again.

This is where your meditation will pay dividends! The more you train yourself to switch your focus and not give energy to distractions the better and faster you will be at programming, coding, society, people, you, your relationships, and emitting less carbon so our children have a prosperous Earth to live on the way we were given her to live on.
