# Welcome to COURSE-TITLE (JS411-Front-End Apps with React)

## Objective Statement TEST?

By the end of the 411 course, students will have built a front-end app with React that uses the database and server built in JS311 to demonstrate their understanding of this technology for their graduation presentation. Coupling their back-end server with their front-end app to complete their full-stack web app Capstone Project.

While this course will incorporate the skills learned in 211 and 311, the main focus is for students to learn a particular library, React, for building dynamic front-end web apps. Students will use the last two weeks of this course to complete their Capstone Project app with the guidance of their instructor.

## Class Structure and Expectations

This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy!

* **Due dates**: Homework is due the **Sunday** after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE!

    * Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the **Submission Due Day**, i.e. *Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday.*
    * Assignments turned in after the **Submission Due Day** will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible.
    * The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty.
    * The **Final Submission Day** for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends.
    * Assignments turned in after the **Final Submission Day** will receive an automatic grade of 50.

* **Homework submission**: Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis.

* **Homework guidelines**: Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete.

* **Grading**: You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment.

* **Late policy**: You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class.

* **Exceptions**: If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements.

### Capstone Project Presentation Guidelines

The purpose of the presentation is to:

* Celebrate the graduates new skills, mindset, and confidence.
* Share with the community the student's ideas and new skills.
* Practice speaking in-public about technology.

A well prepared 3-minute presentation will include:

1. Graduates Name and skills they've been studying
1. The problem the graduate was trying to solve with this app.
1. How the app solves the problem with a demonstration of the app.
1. Where the graduate would like to take the app in the future.
1. Invitation to share the code base with interested patrons after graduation.

The presentation should **NOT** include:

1. An emphasis on sign-on. (*all web apps have a sign-on*)
1. Showing of any code. (*your attendees don't care about code*)

A single drop of poison will turn the test strip positive permanently. You can put any number of drops on a test strip at once and you can reuse a test strip as many times as you'd like (as long as the results are negative.) However, you can only run tests once per day and it takes seven days to return a result. How would you figure out the poisoned bottle in as few days as possible?*
