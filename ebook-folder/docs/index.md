# Welcome to Web 101: Intro to the Web


## Objective Statement

Students who have completed this course will be able to navigate and understand the DOM, use HTML elements and their attributes to style them using CSS rules, and handle DOM events with JavaScript functions. By the end of the course, students will have built multiple static web pages and practiced the skills to build a functional static web page. These skills will transfer directly to the students’ graduation app, completed in their 400 level course. In the students’ 200 level course, they will learn to program small applications before learning to structure data and serve it over the internet in their 300 level course.

## Class Structure and Expectations

This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy!

* **Due dates**: Homework is due the **Sunday** after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE!

    * Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the **Submission Due Day**, i.e. *Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday.*
    * Assignments turned in after the **Submission Due Day** will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible.
    * The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty.
    * The **Final Submission Day** for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends.
    * Assignments turned in after the **Final Submission Day** will receive an automatic grade of 50.

* **Homework submission**: Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis.

* **Homework guidelines**: Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete.

* **Grading**: You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment.

* **Late policy**: You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class.

* **Exceptions**: If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements.

## To Pass This Class (and all others)

To pass Web 101 you will need to:

* Finish with a grade average of >70,
* Attend class 80% of the time,
* Complete your Final Checkpoint,
* Pitch to the class your idea of an app to build for your Capstone Project.
<!-- * And pass the Exit Exam with a >70 grade -->

## Path to Success

* Students are expected to spend their weekends preparing for the next week of class by watching videos, reading tutorials, and working through examples.
* Additionally, there is a "Career Readiness" reading, video, or activity each week. Thus each week you will learn important skills that will help you secure employment upon completion of the course.
* Failure to complete the work outside of class will lead to failure in the class.

Our philosophy is "learn by doing". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects in class.

In these short eight weeks we have with you, we cannot possibly teach you everything there is to know about web development. You will not even learn it all in a career of web development. But we can hope to teach you to become an active learner, an engaged participant, an avid problem solver, and an enthusiastic entrepreneur in your learning journey which will soon become your career. We will lay out for you content that, if read, watched, practiced, and absorbed, will give you a strong foundation in learning every other skill needed to be a successful developer. We will give you challenges that if you face now will give you the know-how, the confidence and skills to tackle any challenge in the workplace.

To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing every "Pre-Homework" assignment before class and continue to reference the assignment during and after class. Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own and bring their questions to class. Class begins by reviewing the "Questions for Discussion" of the "Pre-Homework", and the majority of class time is spent working on projects.

Much of learning to code means understanding what is possible. You are not expected to memorize anything. The important thing is that you are able to ask the right questions to find answers and solve problems. Remember to use this book and every resource you come across, including your classmates, as you progress as a developer here and after school.
