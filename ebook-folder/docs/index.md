# Welcome to Web 101: Intro to the Web

Embark on a web development journey that equips you with the skills to confidently navigate the DOM, design web pages with HTML and CSS, and manage interactions using JavaScript. Throughout this course, you'll build several static web pages, setting a strong foundation for creating functional websites.

These skills will prepare you to build your Graduation/Capstone App by the end of the advanced 400 level course which will prove to the world (and yourself) you can do this! Along the way, you'll learn to program small applications in the 200 level course, advancing to data organization and internet communication in the 300 level course and finally moving to dynamic web apps in the 400 level course.

WEB101 is your gateway to mastering web development, giving you the foundational knowledge, tools and experience to bring your digital ideas to life. Get ready to explore the exciting possibilities in the tech industry.
