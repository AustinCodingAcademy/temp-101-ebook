# Develop Series - Teaching Yourself

*Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. —Og Mandino*

## Overview

In the past 4 weeks, you have learned so many new skills, in areas you knew nothing about before. But one of those skills, which you may not have noticed that you've been learning, is the ability to learn new skills, itself — in particular, those centering on web and software development!

Throughout this course you've been reading documentation, watching videos, and practicing concepts in CodePens. This is a perfect approach to learning new things (as you will continue to do throughout your life and career). In this industry, you must learn new skills all the time: you'll take courses to further your learning, attend conferences, sit in on forums, and bring those new skills back to enrich your teams. It will be a never-ending pursuit.

Do yourself a favor, and start devoting more time to learning now! As with other skills, the more you practice it, the faster and stronger you will get.
