# Talking Code

*Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation. —Brian Tracy*

## Overview

Skills of communicating ideas and information are incredibly important. Why? Because, while coding can get very heady, its impacts on other people are wide and deep. Think of the ways Google has impacted your life! You can now ask for any piece of information, and get a response instantly. You can check on the hours of your favorite restaurant, share your location with your friends and family, look for new places to explore all from your phone — all of this can improve your life. And that's only the beginning!

## Talking Tech

In almost all tech companies, teams meet in the morning to have what's called a daily **[stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meetin)**. This is where all team members come together around a whiteboard and literally stand up in front of the team to present what they are working on that day, what they've accomplished, and what's in their way ("blockers"). This skill is developed with practice over time, and it is very important in communicating to the other team members what is going on in their code environment.

This is not the only place this happens, of course. In **[code planning](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DG2M5yXXEYk)**, teams are asked to research(WHY), plan and present proposals of how a system should be structured(WHAT). After that, they have to delegate the tasks, the timeline(s), and what **sprints** will be needed to building it(HOW)! It's quite incredible how we humans can conjure a mental image, cultivate the idea, formulate the words to convey it, and execute it with intention. These skills of creation are innate, but dedication and committed practice are needed make them flourish and grow inside of you.

Along with stand-ups and code planning, teams also meet for **[retrospectives](https://www.youtube.com/embed/-hnD43Gs_ys)**, which bring out the positives and negatives of the past week's work. This meeting is necessary for the teams can gather perspectives on each other's workflows, and make suggestions and give advice. The process is organic, but also managed and recorded by a team lead, who guides the meeting.

But more impressively, even before any of these meetings happen, developers and entrepreneurs make pitches for their apps to be adopted, funded, and eventually built.

## The Pitch

Any time you have a great idea, and you want to find money or developers to work on it, you have to pitch it. A **pitch** is an approximately five-minute story that lays out the problem, the created solution, and the potential profit of the solution. Here is where we suggest that you go to pitch-practice meetups, to see other do it, and then start practicing, yourself.

Beginning next course you will be pitching your ideas for your Capstone Project. See there's a timeline to this:

101 - Learn fundamentals of web development in the core languages: HTML, CSS, and JS at the same time, plant idea seeds for your Capstone Project.
200 - Learn programming and data manipulation while shaping the story of your Capstone Project.
300 - Build Databases and Server while planning the steps and data requirements to build your Capstone Project.
400 - Learn a front-end library to create a dynamic web app while building your Capstone Project.
501 - Fine tune your Capstone App while preparing for interviews and talking about your App and programming knowledge.

> NOTE: While the app pitched in this video is now closed, the pitch this guy makes is wonderful. Take notes, and ask yourself what makes it a good pitch.

## Practice It - Talking and Standing for Code

Get ready for class by preparing to show off the really cool parts of your website to the class.

- [ ] Take your time.
- [ ] Work on standing still.
- [ ] Notice when you say: "um," "uh," "like," etc.
- [ ] Make eye contact with everyone in the room, to draw them into the project.
- [ ] Practice at home, by navigating through the website while talking aloud.
- [ ] Practice with someone you're comfortable with.
