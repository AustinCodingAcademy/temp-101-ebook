## Creation Time, 110+ mins

Although we're learning new techniques in our Pre-Class lessons this week and next are dedicated to you building a new Portfolio website that each of you and your partner can clone and host for each of you to use when looking for your next role!

Get with your partner in a breakout room, rocketChat, Live-Share, Trello, and/or on the phone and layout together what needs to happen, when it needs to happen and who will be doing what!

To keep you on track we'll all do these at the same time. Ready?

### Organize On Trello - 20 mins

Just like we learned earlier this week create a Trello board that both you and your partner have access to. Create the swim lanes and both of you should start laying out the steps you need to accomplish to build this website.

> HINT: Start with the big steps (landing page, about, contact...) and then you can start breaking those down into the smaller components (header, footer, aside, main...)

### Label Cards with Assignee - 10 mins

Before you move on make sure you both know what your responsibilities are. Assign yourself to the cards that you are responsible for.

### Draw Mockups for the first two pages - 15 mins

Before you code, DRAW! We can't stress this enough. Draw and plan what you want to build. Spend a few minutes to layout on paper what you want your page to look like before you start trying to code it.

### Create Repo + `index.html` file + clone - 10 mins

Get a place for yall's code to go. It doesn't matter who owns it. As long as each of your pull requests are being merged into the `main` branch you'll both be getting credit for your commits.

Go ahead and host it with GitHub Pages and turn in that live URL to be graded later on. (This way you don't forget later on.)

> Remember to work in separate branches *OFF OF* `main`.

### Start Coding

Don't waste time. You have access to your instructor and your partner very easily right now don't let the time slip away. Get going.

Also, don't forget you can use Bootstrap and all of your other project over the past two months.

### The Specifications of your last project

- [ ] A Landing page
- [ ] An About page
- [ ] A Resume page
- [ ] A Contact Me page
- [ ] An image gallery, so to speak, that will serve as your Portfolio Page. It will have thumbnails of all the websites you've built and hosted up to this point, that when clicked they will take you to those websites.
- [ ] design for phone, tablet, and laptop

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] The time remaining, continue on by create a mockup for your next web page.

## Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders, 5 mins

- [ ] Create a checkpoint Final Portfolio Assignment
- [ ] Prepare for next class by completing all of your pre-class lessons
- [ ] Complete the feedback survey(if applicable)
- [ ] Next week we'll be learning more techniques include HTML APIs like Geolocation but during class we'll be focusing our time on our project. Don't stop coding. Use the weekend to coordinate with your partner and keep pushing up your code. We want to see these by the end of our last class!!!
- [ ] Go ahead and turn in your live URL.
- [ ] No blog this weekend, just focus on building your web page.
