## Creation Time, 110+ mins

Now that you have your Trello board broken up into large steps can you sit for 15 mins to break your next page down? Do it with your partner.

### Sprint Planning - 15 mins

If Partner A is working on Contact Page and Partner B is working on the Portfolio Page can you help each other list out what the steps of each of those will be? Go.

### Sprint - 95 mins

Use this time to jump into a breakout room with your project partner and work hard!! Your instructor is here for any questions and support you need.

## Special Homework

While you may not feel this just yet, you now have marketable and employable skills. And while you're moving on to JS211 we want you to understand you can get paid for the skills you have learned up to now. You are a developer!

Your homework assignment:

1. Reflect upon what you've learned so far. Think about what you knew when you started. How did you feel when you started? How do you feel now? At the beginning of class we'll hold time for you to share with each other what you think and feel about what you've learned and finish with the sentiment: "I am a Freelance Web Developer"!

2. Go to your LinkedIn and change your job title to a "Freelance Web Developer".

## Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders, 5 mins

- [ ] Prepare for next class by completing all of your pre-class lessons
- [ ] Complete the feedback survey(if applicable)
- [ ] If you haven't already, turn in a live URL for your project.
- [ ] Keep wire framing and planning.
- [ ] Keep up with your Trello board so you stay mentally organized as well!
- [ ] Special Homework - I am a Developer!

Next class we'll be holding retrospectives, essentially short presentations of everyone's work and discussions about your challenges and learning milestones. Bring your A game, work smartly over the next two days and have fun.

The final project still isn't due until this Sunday after class so don't stress about finishing by next class!
