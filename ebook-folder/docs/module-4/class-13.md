## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

Today you'll clone a boilerplate code base intended for a new developer to quickly begin building a portfolio website for themselves. Then you'll push it to a new repo you've created, work with a partner on different branches to make three buttons/li elements transform. Doing this, you'll create merge conflicts and you'll work together to resolve them to have a fully functioning portfolio website.

### Transform, Animate + Create * Fix Conflicts

Clone and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of the [101-Portfolio-Boilerplate-Boilerplate](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/101-Portfolio-Boilerplate-Boilerplate) repo.

### The Specs

- [ ] Pushed into a new repo owned by one of the students.
- [ ] One new branch for each partner created off of master.
- [ ] Three buttons/li elements to have transformation and animation added to them.
- [ ] Both branches merged.
- [ ] Conflicts resolved.
- [ ] Working Portfolio Boilerplate website.
<!-- - [ ] Turn in the repo's URL **not a live hosted URL** -->

### Team Planning

The remainder of class time is reserved for students to partner up, brainstorm, plan, design, and project plan how they'll use the remaining three classes!

## Exit Recap, Attendance, and Reminders, 5 mins

- [ ] Prepare for next class by completing all of your pre-class lessons
- [ ] Complete the feedback survey(if applicable)

For the next three class we'll be learning many new tools in our pre-class lessons but the focus of class time will be on you and your partner building a website together. Yes, you may use the new tools you've learned in the pre-class lessons but you have enough now to build a fair website that is responsive and professional. Let's make sure we use our time wisely together so you have a polished sight that can be shown to the world!!
