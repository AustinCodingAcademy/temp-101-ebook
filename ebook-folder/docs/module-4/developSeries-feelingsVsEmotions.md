# Develop Series - Feeling vs Emotions, All Together, All at the Same Time

*Knowing other people's stories is the natural block-chain of humanity.*

**Of all the Develop Series, this one is the most important.**

## Overview

Last week we talked about how impactful feelings are on our mental, spiritual, and physical well-being, even down to the biological level! We also learned about the difference between paying attention and seeking attention. This week, let's learn how to take action and affect each of those. Now that your awareness is keyed in on them you can actively pursue what's best for you, your family, and everyone around you.

## Get Your Feelings Outside of You

Most of us don't know we're actually in control of our feelings. We have been taught to live within rules but when things don't go our way our emotions arise and our feelings go haywire! We start blaming others and shutting down. What if that didn't have to be the case! What if instead we could learn about ourselves, not just how we physically move like walking and talking, but also about our emotion state. What if we could tune into our inner world in a way that we could actually change it and make a real difference?!?

Alan Watkins presents a fascinating and moving explanation of our self-development from infancy to who you are now and why we should pay attention to what's going on inside of us! Check it out.
