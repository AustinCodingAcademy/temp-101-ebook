# Life Happens For You

*The purpose of spirituality is to end suffering. - The Buddha*

Spirituality recognizes that your role in life has a greater value than what you do every day. It can relieve you from dependence on material things and help you to understand your life's greater purpose. Spirituality can also be used as a way of coping with change or uncertainty.
