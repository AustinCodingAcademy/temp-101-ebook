# Helping Yourself (the only way there is)

Inevitably, you will get stuck on something. And yes, in your future jobs you will have someone on your team (ideally) to ask but that will still only be reserved for when you *really* can't figure it out. 

Try to imagine why someone would hire you for a developer position. They are paying you to figure out problems. That is your number one job: find solutions to problems. 

With this in mind, we are not only training you in software development but also problem-solving and building **your own** trust and confidence in **yourself** to find **your own** solution.

To that end we've put together a guide for your to solve your own problems before reaching out to a tutor.

The quick list goes like this:

- [ ] Check the curriculum. Simply type ++f++ to bring up the search bar and type in what you're looking for.
- [ ] Ask the [virtual mentor](https://chatbottutor-7e7843ea9900.herokuapp.com/) that works in the context of your curriculum.
- [ ] Google the issue. Find a solution on StackOverflow, GitHub, Geeks4Geeks, MDN, W3Schools, Reddit, etc.
- [ ] Ask your fellow students and alumni in the Discord general channel. They'd love to help you out!
- [ ] Lastly, [book mentor](https://austincodingacademy.com/tutors). This should be your **very very LAST stop** for solving your problem. You won't have this in the "real world" so use this with caution and be forewarned.

### Book a Tutor Restrictions

The goal is not to deter you from asking for help but to help you  to build the habits that will lead you to have a long career. 

Ideally, you would walk into a tutoring session with only after you'd tried everything else before and were able to say something like: *"Hi, I am having trouble having my code to do Z, I have looked in the curriculum but it only got me to X and further research got me to Y. What do you recommend I do to get me to Z?"* 

From experience, 70% of problems will fix be resolved through troubleshooting on your own. For the last 30% the help the tutors give you plus your improved troubleshooting practices will lead to a better experience in school and the job search. 

Finally, to help track these interactions, please fill out the [Technical Mentoring Form](https://share.hsforms.com/1jAYhAD-XRTGqFM-dSw3ZcQcz8tq) for every official tutoring session, this does not include sessions during class. 

If you cannot follow these guidelines we will restrict your access to tutors until you can prove you've learned to find help on your own.
