## Special Elements like Images

**Mkdocs and Material** along with a nice extension called pym... allow for some serious control over your documentation (learning materials). Here's an example of an image aligned to the right:

![Placeholder](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){: align=right } see it there?

<!-- ![objectModelDrawing-101-1-4](./../../images/objectModelDrawing-101-1-4.png){: align=right } See it there? -->

********************
We can add any bit of text we want to make our ebook's flow more interestingly!

Unfortunately you have to have quite a bit to say here otherwise the next sections gets caught up in here unless you can find a good solution for this!!
********************

<figure>
  <img src="https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa" width="300" />
  <figcaption>Using HTML we can create captions</figcaption>
  <figcaption>And control their dimensions</figcaption>

### And Videos

## Code Blocks & Snippets

Need some code fencing and annotation?

=== "Javascript"

    ```javascript

      const myVariable = 8

      const addSix = num => {
        return num + 6
      }

    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    my_variable = 8

    def add_six(num):
      return num + 6
    
    print(add_six(my_variable))

    ```

  `const addSix = num => {`
:   When we pass one and only one argument to a function declared with the `const` keyword we don't HAVE to wrap it with `( )`.

Or Like this:

=== "HTML"

    ```html
    <!-- this section is the parent/container element -->
    <section class="truthful-statements">
      <!-- Each of these article elements are child elements/flex items -->
      <article>A connected life is the best life.</article>
      <article>People have dogs. Some have cats.</article>
      <article>Human activity is capturing heat at an alarming rate!</article>
    </section>
    ```
=== "CSS"

    ```css
    /* the CSS to make it happen */
    .truthful-statements {
      display: flex;
    }

    article {
      border-color: blue;
      border-style: solid;
      border-width: 1pt;
      margin: 20pt 5pt;
      padding: 2pt 5pt;
    }
    ```

=== "Result"
    ![truthful-statements-flex-demo](./../images/truthful-statements-flex-demo.png)

<br/>

  ```html

    <section class="row gallery-two">
        <!--  Copy/Paste the line below for as many images as you'd like   -->
        <img src="" alt="what the image is" height="360" width="240">
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/CBnvmgOvK1d9C/giphy.gif" alt="what the image is" height="360" width="240">
    </section>

  ```

  `line numbers`
:do you like 'em?

  > NOTE: Make sure to indent your fence block's properly.


  <!-- Diagrams with the mermaid package may be available in the future -->

### In-line Code + Keyboard buttons!!

What about some in-line `code`? Like `this` and `.bind()`. Or `color:`, `height:`, `width:`, `z-index:`, `font-size:`? 

What about keys? ++ctrl+alt+del++,  ++enter++,  ++space++,  ++l++, or ++esc++
<!-- Full list here: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/keys/ -->

  > NOTE: Indent additional comments like this.
