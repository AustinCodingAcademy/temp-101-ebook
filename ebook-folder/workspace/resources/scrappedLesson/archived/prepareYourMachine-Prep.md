You'll need 3 essential tools on your machine (*computer*):

1. A **Web Browser**, *Chrome*

    * Sure, you can surf the web with [Internet Explorer](https://images.app.goo.gl/5wB4XwZjQGgjL3ny9), Edge, Opera, Firefox or Safari; but Chrome has the strongest built-in developer tools of all browsers. Download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and give yourself an advantage. You can read up on [Chrome's power](https://medium.com/frontmen/art-of-debugging-with-chrome-devtools-ab7b5fd8e0b4) here.

1. A **Text Editor**, *VS Code*

    * A "text editor" is exactly what it sounds like – an application that allows you to edit text, (and store it in a file). When we write code, prior to executing it, we'll use a text editor. There are plenty of text editors out there — from minimal editors to elaborate Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) — including Atom, SublimeText, IntelliJ, Brackets, WebStorm, VIM, TextWrangler, RubyMine... and even NotePad. Some are pay-to-use, others are free. We will use the free, but powerful and well supported, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. A **Terminal** or **Terminal Emulator**

    * Think of the **terminal** or **CLI**, (*Command-Line Interface*), as a short-cut to your machine. Normally we access our computer's programs and files through a **GUI**, (*Graphical User Interface* (pronounced: "gooey")). GUIs are nice and pretty but sometimes we need to access the computer more directly and efficiently. We can do this using the Command-Line.

    * Mac Users have a built in terminal, simply hold **command** + **spacebar** then type in "terminal" + **enter**.
    * Windows User pre-Windows 10 will need to download [gitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to work as your terminal emulator.
        * *See: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)*
    * Windows 10+ can use the built-in [Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840)

* We will use these terminals or terminal emulators later in the course. For now, just make sure you have them and are able to access them.
