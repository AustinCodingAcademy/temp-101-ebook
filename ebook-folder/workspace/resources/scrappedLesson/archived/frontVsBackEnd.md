### Read It - Front vs Back

Next, let's take a moment to demystify the difference between the Front-End and the Back-End, something that we've touched on a bit already. As you build your Capstone Project or any other app, you'll normally be bundling both front-end code and back-end code together in the same place.

As a professional developer, you would usually divide these two sets of code into different folders like:  `client/` and `server/`, so you and your team know where to find certain functionality. In this case, your file structure would look like this:

```console
  myCapstoneApp/
      client/
        index.html
        style.css
        scripts.js
      server/
        routes.cs
        auth.cs
        app.cs
```

This may look foreign to you right now, but it is something that you will become familiar with as you move through the program. For now, just try and keep the separation between front-end and back-end in your mind. Luckily, we keep a similar structure. and separation in your courses to help out:

  * 101 Level is about the Front-End: HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation with JavaScript
  * 200 Level focuses on Programming Basics that will be used on both Front- and Back-End
  * 300 Level is all about the Back-End: SQL, Databases, and back-end JavaScript
  * 400 Level focuses on the Front & the passing of data from Front- to Back-.

### Read On - The Definitions To Refer Back To

* [Client-side](https://www.sqa.org.uk/e-learning/ClientSide01CD/page_18.htm) refers to all of the data manipulation that happens on your personal computer or machine's web browser, i.e. Chrome or Firefox. Often times, web sites will use the computing and storage resources of your personal computer to deliver content to you faster or simply to save themselves money. You'll learn about all the things that are happening on your *Client-side*, (that you don't see), in 411.

* [Front-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) refers to converting data from the back-end to a graphical user interface (GUI, for short (pronounced "gooey")) for users to view and interact with the data in a presentational way like you're doing right now! The Front-End includes the pictures, buttons, checkboxes, sliders, inputs, or effects you see on your screen whenever you visit any website. The only languages used for this are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll cover each of these in this course so that you will, in fact, be able to build your own website and web games by the end of it.

* [Back-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) refers to the code written strictly to access, handle and manipulate data on the [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting). This is where all the "magic happens". Without the back-end, the front-end is only a pretty moving picture. But with the back-end, the front-end is an interactive world where we can engage with billions of people across the globe. We'll cover the Back-End in 311, but for now, you should know that it includes databases and the servers that serve the data from those databases.
