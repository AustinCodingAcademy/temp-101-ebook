Many of us only consume the web through the web browser, but there is a significant portion of the world that does not. Many users rely on **screen readers**,  **monochrome displays** or other technologies of assistance. To accommodate these users you'll have to learn small pieces at a time. We'll do our best to include these accommodations for every project so that you will have a firm grasp of how to implement them by the time you finish this course.
