## Read It

Every section in this textbook consists of an overview video that is designed to help you understand what you're about to learn and why it's important. After watching the video you'll also have a "Read It" section (like this one) that will provide more context and detail. We all learn in different ways but we also learning in the same ways. Video might be better for some while reading is better for others, however, the reinforcement from both angles is ideal for all.

Throughout this course, you will be consuming your work through a variety of different mediums – reading, videos, hands-on coding platforms, and more. This approach is part of a well-documented and successful teaching and learning strategy called [Differentiated Learning](https://www.weareteachers.com/what-is-differentiated-instruction/), whereby we active different regions of your brain to help you notice patterns and build your own understandings. Take the time with each "Read It" and "Know Your Docs" section to build your understanding, draw conclusions, and take notes of what you've realized.

Following these sections will usually be another video – "See It" – that dives into the application of the concept and then a "Practice It" section that gives you the opportunity to tinker with the concept in a hands-on way.

Please, please, please, practice the problems during your homework. Teach yourself to approach a problem and figure it out yourself. You will gain so much satisfaction, confidence, and gainful understanding if you apply your mind to each and every problem!

### The Develop Series

Each week, you'll also be training to be a better learner, listener, person, thinker, entrepreneur. These qualities transcend programming and web development and will carry you much further than you though possible. Coupled with coding, these skills will make you a fierce collaborator in the job market and build a foundation for you future. Are you ready?
