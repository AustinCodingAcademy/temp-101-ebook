To work in the course you'll need three essential tools on your machine (computer): a **web browser**, a **text editor**, a **terminal** or and **terminal emulator** (a.k.a. command line interface or CLI).

The short checklist looks like this:

- [ ] [Download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [ ] [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [ ] Terminal:
    * [ ] MacOS has a built-in terminal
    * [ ] Windows 10+ has Command Prompt
    * [ ] Windows <=9 will need to [download GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Chrome (a web browser)

When consuming content through the internet, users/we need a program that can render the streams of data sent to our computer (laptop or phone) from other computers (the cloud) through the internet. The general name for this type of program is called a browser. Yes, you can surf the internet with other browsers like Internet Explore, Edge, Opera, Firefox or Safari, but Chrome undoubtedly has the strongest built-in dev tools of any browser. In this course and all the following courses weâ€™ll be using Chrome. Be sure to download Chrome. After that:

### Practice It - Using Chrome

  - [ ] [Master Bookmark Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu4B86UM7l4)
  - [ ] [Organized Your Bookmarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pILjLVJgi7s)
  - [ ] Shortcut Practice: ++cmd+t++ = open new tab
  - [ ] Shortcut Practice: ++cmd+shift+t++ = reopen last closed tab
  - [ ] Shortcut Practice: ++cmd+r++ = refresh the current tab
  - [ ] Shortcut Practice: ++cmd+w++ = close the current tab

> NOTE: For Windows machines use ++ctrl++ instead of ++cmd++.

## VS Code (an IDE/text editor)

A **text editor** is simply a tool used to edit your code and organize it into files before it is executed. There are plenty of text editors or **IDE**s including Atom, SublimeText, IntelliJ, Brackets, WebStorm, VIM, TextWrangler, RubyMine and even NotePad. Some are paid, others are free, but for our use-case and to get the most powerful text editor for the buck we're going to use the free and well-supported [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Be sure to download it and then continue to [read up](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/mac-text-editors/) on other text editors as you grow as a developer.

## Terminal or Terminal Emulator

A **terminal** or **Command Line Interface**(CLI) is a way for you to interact with your computer's core functionality without building a **GUI**, a **Graphical User Interface**. GUIs are what we give to people that don't know how to work with code. We learn to work in terminals because later on we'll be interacting with remote servers and the only way we can talk to them is sending them messages through a CLI command.

Think of the terminal or **CLI** (command line interface) as a shortcut to the computer. Normally we access our computer's programs and files through a GUI (graphical user interface, pronounced: "gooey"). A GUI is nice and pretty, but sometimes we need to access the computer more directly and in a more efficient way. We can do this using the command line interface, or command line for short.

### Installation/Accessing a Terminal on Your Computer

=== "Macs"

    - [ ] Mac users have a built in terminal. To access it, simply hold ++cmd+space++
    - [ ] A Spotlight search bar should appear. Type in "terminal" then hit ++enter++.
    - [ ] But you'll need [homebrew](https://brew.sh) so run this in your terminal: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` and say yes to [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). (*this will take a while*)

=== "Windows 10+"

    - [ ] Windows 10 comes built with [Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840), a command line interpreter. It acts the same way as the command line and is in this way a command line emulator.
    - [ ] Open Command Prompt via the Command Prompt shortcut located in the Start menu or on the Apps screen, depending on your version of Windows.
    - [ ] [Learn how to use the Windows command line](https://youtu.be/MBBWVgE0ewk).

=== "Windows < 10"

    - [ ] If you are using a pre-Windows 10 machine then you will need to [download GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) to work as your terminal emulator.
    - [ ] [Learn GitBash commands](https://youtu.be/oQc-2gsjgDg).

> NOTE: We'll use these terminals or terminal emulators throughout this course and each one afterward, so make sure you can access them for now.

<!-- 
### Node

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to build applications(apps) in JavaScript and run them outside of a browser(the native place for JavaScript). With Node downloaded on our computer we'll be able to build terminal apps in 211, servers in 311 and web apps in 411! Go ahead and download Node but don't do anything with it until the Node Lesson later on.
