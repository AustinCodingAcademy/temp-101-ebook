## The History of Software Development

You may be confused by the terms **Software Development** and **Web Development**. It can be difficult to find clear answers to conceptual questions like these when you're just starting out. So let's take a high-level look at some of the most significant developments in the history of technology that led us to the world of **Software Development**:

* 2700 B.C.E. - The first abacus is invented
* 87 B.C.E. - Antikythera is the first Analog Computer
* 1703 - the Binary Number System is introduced
* 1837 - Charles Babbage first described his Analytical Engine
* 1843 - The first Computer Algorithm is created....*by a woman named, Ada Lovelace*
* 1936 - The Turing Machine is invented
* 1941 - The first programmable computer is invented
* 1947 - The transistor is invented allowing for switching of electrical currents
* 1963 - The first mouse is created
* 1968 - DARPA creates ARPAnet, the precursor to the internet
* 1985 - Microsoft Windows 1.0
* 1990 - Sir Tim Berners-Lee creates the modern internet
* 1995 - JavaScript is created as a scripting language for the internet
* 1998 - Google is started
* 2004 - Facebook begins
* 2009 - Node is created allowing for JavaScript to be used in the back-end
* 2012 - The first Lyft is taken

After looking through this very terse history of software development you might notice the movement toward the internet begins after 1963. This is because as software development picked up in the decades before the invention of the internet, developers were met with a problem. Software created before 1990 had to be distributed to its users by snail-mail on a floppy disk, CD, or – worst of all – on a computer's hardware itself. What this meant was that the software had to be *absolutely* perfect before it was purchased, otherwise, developers would be shipping bugs into environments that they couldn't fix. Unlike today where we can download software updates directly to our devices, any software update had to be physically shipped out via floppy disk or cd.

Once the internet was adopted into the mainstream, software teams could develop their product in iterations and deliver the updates to each device over the internet. (i.e., Did you hear about how [Tesla was able to adjust its stopping distance on the Model 3 by sending a software update over-the-air](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/2/17413732/tesla-over-the-air-software-updates-brakes)?) Besides Tesla updates, you receive software updates all the time on your phone and personal computer, (PC). This sort of iterative development is much easier, quicker, and cheaper than physical updates via **CDs** or **flash drives**.

## Summary

So then what is **Web Development**? Well, it is just the same as Software Development. In fact, it is *exactly* the same. The only distinguishing feature between Web Development and Software Development is that files built for Web Development are served from a remote computer to your local computer and read by a web browser. Therefore, as a web developer you'll be building **websites**, **web apps**, and even **mobile apps** for users to interact with and communicate with databases and other users. Your code won't be running directly on someone's computer the way traditional software does, (think iMovie, Windows, or Sketch). Instead, the software you will develop is meant to be consumed by a web browser.
