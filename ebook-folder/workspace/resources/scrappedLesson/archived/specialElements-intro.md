In addition to the other element you've come across, be sure to spend a few minutes with each of these and reference back to them.

## Block And Special Elements

1. Paragraph Tags: `<p>These are like divs, but will give you a little space around them, like **paragraphs** in a book.</p>`

1. Image Tags: `<img src="http://placekitten.com/200/300" alt="a sweet little kitten/>`
    * The `<img />` needs a `src` attribute to provide the image we want to display, written as `<img src="http://www.myimagesite.com/myimage.jpg">`. For Accessibility purposes, you MUST put an `alt=` attribute on your Image tags.

1. Anchor or Link Tags: `<a href="https://google.com">Search the web!</a>`
    * Similarly, the anchor tag `<a>` needs an `href` attribute - a _**h**ypertext **ref**erence_ - if we want it to link to another location.

### A Little Deeper Header tags: `<h1>` Within Section Tags: `<section>`

A `<h1>` tag should be used to name what the content is about inside the current **Sectional Semantic Element** i.e. an `<article>` or `<section>`.

Here is an in-depth article about this technique: [The Truth About Multiple H1 Tags in the HTML5 Era](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-truth-about-multiple-h1-tags-in-the-html5-era--webdesign-16824).

## Practice It

1. Take the elements you just learned and throw them into a new CodePen. Play and see what you can build with them.
