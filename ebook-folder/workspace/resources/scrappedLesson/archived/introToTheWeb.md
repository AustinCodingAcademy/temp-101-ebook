### Read It

The **internet** may seem vast, daunting, and unreal. Often times, people don't stop to ask how it works. And really, they don't need to. They just need to know how to use it.

You, on-the-other-hand, are embarking on a journey to hone your knowledge and skills of web development. In order for you to know what you're doing and what is possible, you'll need to understand how the web functions. We'll start by start by laying out a map of terms, concepts, and flows so that you can begin to create your own mental models of how this thing we use every day actually functions.

We'll talk about each of these terms in-depth in the next lessons, but let's just throw them out there for now since you'll be hearing each of them every day for the rest of your career.

#### Front-End/Client-Side

[Front-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) / [Client-Side](https://www.sqa.org.uk/e-learning/ClientSide01CD/page_18.htm) refers to the part of the internet you're looking at right now. The Front- or Client- simply means the sections that users see when navigating the web.

#### Back-End/Server-Side

By contrast, the [Back-End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) / [Server-Side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting) is the section of the internet that the user can't see. This is where **data**, *(information stored in numbers and letters)*, is stored in **databases** as well as the **servers** and programs running on those servers called Application Programming Interfaces **(APIs)**, live.

We use these words to plan, divide work, assign tasks, and create solutions. In web development, the front-end can't work without the back-end collecting data and information, and the back-end isn't useful to humans without a front-end to navigate. Developers that work on both front-end and back-end are known as **Full Stack Developers**. In this program you'll learn to build in both the front-end and back-end, giving you the tools to work as a Full-Stack Developer. What you may find as you progress through this program and through your career afterward is that developers tend to gravitate towards one or the other. This is perfectly normal. But whether you are a Full Stack, Front-End, or Back-End Developer, it will only help you professionally to understand how both of these aspects of web development come together.

If you're interested in learning a bit more about the day-to-day difference between a Front-End and Back-End Developer, feel free to read more here:

Back to our [introduction to the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works):

A **server** (*where the back-end code is executed*) holds files like an `index.html` at certain addresses called URLs. When we navigate the web, our web browser, (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), can request access to those files through **URL addresses**.

You see, servers still hold front-end code but only front-end tools like a web browser are able to read/execute them. Thus, servers *serve* files to our client-side browser so that we're able to view them as webpages. It really is as simple as that!

Now, when we build our front-end apps in this class, we won't have access to a server to serve these files. Instead, we'll use a technique called **Local Hosting** where we'll use your **Local Machine**, (Computer), to both serve the files and then read the files within your browser. We'll talk about how to do this with [Live-Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and at an address like `localhost:5500` later on.
