The Specifications/Specs
Draw up wireframes for mobile, tablet, and laptop.
Your images should come from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and your Inspirational Quotes should come from [Keep Inspiring](https://www.keepinspiring.me/positive-inspirational-life-quotes/).
Your Image Gallery should also be responsive. You can do this how you like but here is a nice [How To: Responsive Image Gallery](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp). We suggest you use it! Remember, open-source.
When a user hovers over each image, a new quote should appear over the top of each of the images.
Use this [Guide on Image Overlay Fade](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_fade)
You will also need this sweet CSS snippet: `background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* Black background with 0.5 opacity */`
Create an Easter Egg. On one of your images, surprise your user with a fun Animation that happens when they hover over it. Use [W3S How To](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/) to find something you like
Make sure you create new files for this project like: `image-gallery.html` & `image-gallery-styles.css`.
Remember your layout must be designed for mobile, tablet, and laptop!
Remember to create a link to this new web page in your `portfolio` page so visitors can get to it like they can to your NASA page.
Lastly, when you turn this in, it should be the live URL of your hosted website so the URL will end in `/image-gallery.htm`. This way your instructor can go straight to your page to grade rather than navigate through your entire Portfolio website.
To begin, go to your Portfolio Website Folder and create a new folder inside of it called: "Image-Gallery-Page". Inside of that folder create two files called: "image-gallery.html" & "gallery-styles.css" and a folder called "images" to store your images in.
When you're finished link your new image gallery to the portfolio button on the landing page, "index.html".
Since you understand how the `<img>` tag, `grid`, amd `flex` work as well as how to read documentation, this shouldn't be a problem for you!

Push Yourself Further
Wouldn't it be cool to [use JS to change your Image Gallery Layout](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_image_grid.asp)? Take a look at that code example and see if you can implement it into your image gallery.
With an onclick, can you [create a light box](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp)?
