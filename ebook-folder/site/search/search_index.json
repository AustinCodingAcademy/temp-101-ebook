By the end of the course, students will have built multiple static web pages and practiced the skills to build a functional static web page. These skills will transfer directly to the students\u2019 graduation app, completed in their 400 level course. In the students\u2019 200 level course, they will learn to program small applications before learning to structure data and serve it over the internet in their 300 level course. Class Structure and Expectations This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy! Due dates : Homework is due the Sunday after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE! Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the Submission Due Day , i.e. Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday. Assignments turned in after the Submission Due Day will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible. The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty. The Final Submission Day for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends. Assignments turned in after the Final Submission Day will receive an automatic grade of 50. Homework submission : Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Homework guidelines : Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete. Grading : You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment. Late policy : You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class. Exceptions : If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements. To Pass This Class (and all others) To pass Web 101 you will need to: Finish with a grade average of >70, Attend class 80% of the time, Complete your Final Checkpoint, Pitch to the class your idea of an app to build for your Capstone Project. Path to Success Students are expected to spend their weekends preparing for the next week of class by watching videos, reading tutorials, and working through examples. Additionally, there is a \"Career Readiness\" reading, video, or activity each week. Thus each week you will learn important skills that will help you secure employment upon completion of the course. Failure to complete the work outside of class will lead to failure in the class. Our philosophy is \"learn by doing\". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects in class. In these short eight weeks we have with you, we cannot possibly teach you everything there is to know about web development. You will not even learn it all in a career of web development. But we can hope to teach you to become an active learner, an engaged participant, an avid problem solver, and an enthusiastic entrepreneur in your learning journey which will soon become your career. We will lay out for you content that, if read, watched, practiced, and absorbed, will give you a strong foundation in learning every other skill needed to be a successful developer. We will give you challenges that if you face now will give you the know-how, the confidence and skills to tackle any challenge in the workplace. To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing every \"Pre-Homework\" assignment before class and continue to reference the assignment during and after class. Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own and bring their questions to class. Class begins by reviewing the \"Questions for Discussion\" of the \"Pre-Homework\", and the majority of class time is spent working on projects. Much of learning to code means understanding what is possible. You are not expected to memorize anything. The important thing is that you are able to ask the right questions to find answers and solve problems. Remember to use this book and every resource you come across, including your classmates, as you progress as a developer here and after school.

Try it ! 1 < p > Hello World </ p > 1 2 3 4 5 p { border-style : groove ; border-width : 12 pt ; border-color : #FF9633 ; } Just like padding (and margin) there is a short-hand, border : 1 2 3 p { border : groove 12 pt #AA9933 ; } NOTE: Again, this short-hand comes with a warning: it is less readable than the long-hand form. More Long-Hand To complicate things a little more there are properties that allow us to style each side of the border differently. This isn't all that common but it becomes VERY useful when you're creating strange and interesting shapes on the screen. Try it ! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 p { border-style : groove ; border-top-color : blue ; border-top-width : 75 pt ; border-right-color : green ; border-right-width : 40 pt ; border-right-style : dotted ; border-bottom-color : purple ; border-bottom-width : 100 pt ; border-left-color : red ; border-left-width : 60 pt ; border-left-style : dotted ; } Above you can see there are properties for each side so you are able to control -style , -color , and -width of each side as you please!! Border Counts for Total Width There's a small \"gotcha\" with borders. Because borders are often invisible they don't have a value on the screen which means that count in the total amount of \"available space\". But, when you start add value to the border-width , it will start to push outward affecting the element's neighbor(s). The docs will say: \"Although an element's border is bound to the element itself, border settings will affect neighboring elements.\" NOTE: Check out the docs ahead to see all the values these properties can take.

New Length Units By default, the dimension of an element is the size of the content contained within the element. This means that when you create an <article> element it won't have a height that you can see on the screen because there is nothing inside of it. But as soon as you add content you'll be able to see it grow to fit the amount of content. We can, of course, make the element larger than the content by changing its width and height properties. The width and height properties take the traditional px (pixel) unit like the other properties you've read about so far, but now we'll throw a curve ball at you: All of the properties you've read about take far more length units than just the traditional px , including: in , cm , mm , em , rem , vh , vw , % , pt and many more. \"Why so many?\" That's a good question that doesn't really need to be answered right now. Suffice it to say that there have been many additions to the CSS language trying to accommodate for designers working on computers. The ones I'd like you to focus your attention on right now are % and pt . Percentage is Dynamic % , or percentage , tells the child element to be displayed at a specified percentage, or proportion, of its parent element. Check out the example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <!-- index.html file --> < article > < p > The red fox jumped over the green turtle. </ p > </ article > < style > /* style.css file */ article { width : 500 px ; height : 600 px ; } article > p { width : 90 % ; height : 50 % ; } </ style > In the example above, the <article> element, or parent element, will be 500px by 600px while the <p> element, or child element, will be rendered at 450px( 90% ) by 300px( 50% ) because it is set to be a percentage of its parent element. This is really useful when parent elements are set to be sized in proportion to their parent element like maybe . . . <body> . See the example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 <!-- index.html file --> < article > < p > The red fox jumped over the green turtle. </ p > </ article > < style > /* style.css file */ /* The <body> element will be automatically set to the height and width of the viewport, or display of the computer, tablet, or phone's window */ body { width : auto ; height : auto ; } /* Then the <article> element will be set to 50% as wide as the whole <body> and 100% as tall as the <body> */ article { width : 50 % ; height : 100 % ; } /* Can I assume you can guess what the paragraph element will do? */ article > p { width : 90 % ; height : 50 % ; } </ style > Using percentages is advantageous because you will never know all the sizes of screens that will view your web pages; this way you can tell elements to be a specific percentage of the available area instead of hard coded pixels! Follow It Up with Min- & Max- When using percentages as values it's important to include the min-width / max-width and min-height / max-height properties so as to avoid your elements being rendered in sizes that are unmanageable for the user. See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 body { width : auto ; height : auto ; min-width : 100 pt ; /* <--- Notice the use of the pt unit */ max-width : 1000 pt ; min-height : 150 pt ; max-height : 1500 pt ; } Above you saw the use of pt or points . These are a little more reliable than px which are relative to the number of pixels in a user's display and other factors . The pt value is equal to 1/72nd of an inch so you can calculate a little more easily the size of your elements. View-height & View-Width The last units you should know about are vh and vw which stand for view-height and view-width , respectively. These are very useful units except for the fact that they are not supported on all previous versions of mobile browsers.

Did anyone not get them opened? Partner up and help each other. Create a Repo on GitHub First, Sign-in to GitHub. At the top-right of the screen click on the \"+\" icon and select \"New Repository\" In the \"Repository Name\" field type: web101_firstName_lastName NOTE: remember to change firstName for your actual first name and lastName for your actual last name. In the \"Description field\" type: \"This is my portfolio website!\" Make it \"Public\" by clicking the radio button next to Public. So your instructor can view it. Check the box to \"Initialize this repository with a README.md\" NOTE: This is a file we'll use later on and you'll understand why it's important to use later on. Click \"Create Repository\". After this you should see a screen that looks like this: Find your Portfolio Folder in the terminal by either: dragging and dropping the folder in the terminal Use the command cd to change directories until you're inside the folder. Type pwd to confirm your in the correct folder. Then use these commands one after another. They're modified a little from the image above. git init - this will initialize the folder as a folder for the git software to watch. git add -A - this adds all the files you created for your Portfolio Landing Page. git commit -m \"first commit\" - This stages your new files to be added to the remote remote, you're \"committing\" to the changes. git branch -M main - GitHub recently changed the name of the \"main\" branch from master to main . This command ensure you're using main as your \"main\" branch. git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/web101-firstName_lastName.git - Attaches the remote repo to this local folder. NOTE: be sure you replace the link wit the link given to YOU from gitHub. git push -u origin main - pushes your committed files up to the remote repo. Watch the progress in your terminal then refresh the tab with your GitHub Repo to see if the files are there. In your terminal you're looking for feedback that looks like this: Pause and Partner: What problems have you encountered? Is there anyone that was rejected by GitHub? Password? Username? Let's partner up according to our problems and help each other get through them! Who's successful and who is struggling? Follow-Up Video: Creating a Repo and Using Git Is anyone having a trouble push ing? Maybe your configurations aren't set correctly. See next section: Git Configurations NOTE: Mac users can learn to setup the code . path for VS Code in this video. Git Configurations When you're pushing code to a repo, Git needs to know who you are so it can sign-in to GitHub. It uses your username/email and password to do this. If you don't setup this configuration, git will populate your email with an address assigned to your computer that doesn't match your account on GitHub. NOTE: if while doing these steps you'll see a strange looking screen pop up, it might be your computer's default text editor, VIM or VI . Just follow the instructions below and/or watch the video to use it. Set up Git Config(urations) All Machine Users Set your git username. In your terminal, copy/paste this code and replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username: git config --global user.name \"YOUR-USERNAME\" + ENTER Now, set your email. In your terminal, copy/paste this code and replace YOUR EMAIL with the email you used to create your GitHub account: git config --global user.email \"YOURemail@address.com\" + ENTER Note: If it asks you for a password this is your GitHub account password VIM/VI - How to Use It When doing your git config you may see a more unusual window in your terminal. it will have a bunch of ~ or # along the left side. This is a built-in text editor like VS Code but very stripped down. It allows you to change files and write code. For this step you'll be changing your .gitconfig file to contain your username and email. VIM has two modes: Insert (input text) and Command (move around and do stuff). For now, we really only need to insert text, but you'll need to know how to get in and out of the two different modes. To start the Insert Mode : Press i to enter Insert mode and press esc to begin Command mode . You'll know which one you're in because \"insert\" will appear at the bottom of the screen when you enter insert mode. While Command Mode is active you navigate around the page with your arrow keys (d-pad). When you need to type in your email or anything else, press i . You're then free to type in whatever you need. In this .gitconfig file all lines that begin with # are read as \"comments\" meaning the computer doesn't read them. Make sure you remove them from the important lines. Ask your instructor. When you're finished inserting, press esc to move back to Command mode . Then to exit and save the file type :wq + ENTER. This simply says to the computer: \"I'm about to give you a command( : ), write the file( w ) then quit the program( q ).\" NOTE: If you're lost, it's totally fine. VIM is an old relic that's stuck around and become a hipster text editor but really it's there so you can always change files, no matter what! If you're having trouble: Git Config How-To Video Pause and Partner: How we doing? Try git push ing again. Who hasn't been able to push? Practice It Again: Add A file and Push It Now that you've configured your git software and learned the status , add , commit , push process, let's practice using git again. Create another file in the same directory called: .gitignore . Then copy/paste this code into that file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 ### macOS ### # General .DS_Store .AppleDouble .LSOverride # Icon must end with two \\r Icon # Thumbnails ._* # Files that might appear in the root of a volume .DocumentRevisions-V100 .fseventsd .Spotlight-V100 .TemporaryItems .Trashes .VolumeIcon.icns .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent # Directories potentially created on remote AFP share .AppleDB .AppleDesktop Network Trash Folder Temporary Items .apdisk ### Windows ### # Windows thumbnail cache files Thumbs.db Thumbs.db:encryptable ehthumbs.db ehthumbs_vista.db # Dump file *.stackdump # Folder config file [Dd]esktop.ini # Recycle Bin used on file shares $RECYCLE.BIN/ # Windows Installer files *.cab *.msi *.msix *.msm *.msp # Windows shortcuts *.lnk # Sensitive Environment Variables .env # VS CODE .vscode/settings.json # End of https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/macos,windows NOTE: This step is mainly for Mac users but really all users should know how to use .gitignore which is a file that git software looks for and will ignore whatever you write inside of it. Its good practice to include this file with all projects you do in the future. To move this file up to your remote repo by running these commands in order: git status - check to see what files you've changed and that you hit \"SAVE\" git add .gitignore - Adds the changed file to the staging area. git commit -m \"to git to ignore certain files\" - Commits the file changes with a descriptive message about the changes made. git push - pushes the change from the staging area to the remote repo. Make a note for yourself!! Every time you make substantial changes to your code bases you'll run these commands in this order EVERYTIME! Pause & Partner : How we doing? Any questions about these four commands? Who didn't get this .gitignore file into their repo? Serve Your Landing Page Now that your web page is hosted on a publicly available computer, GitHub's server, you can change the permissions and allow for it to seen by the world! Go back to the repo you just created on GitHub then go to the \"Settings Tab\". Under the Settings, scroll down almost to the bottom of the page until you see \"GitHub Pages\". Click the None dropdown and select main branch and then click \"Save\". Now, scroll back down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section and you'll see a section that says \"Your site is ready to be published at https://yourusername.github.io/ .\" - This is the ROOT of your live site. In order to see your live site, you need to put in the rest of the URL's path . Use your browser to navigate to: https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/ACA_web101_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME/myPortfolio/index.html NOTE: Do you see how the forward-slashes / in the URL look the exact same as the path names in our <link/> tags? That's because server-computers hold files the same way your personal computer does and the structure of the directories are the same, i.e. the current path to your portfolio looks like: documents/DevFolder/myPortfolio/index.html . All computers are built the same way and talk the same way. Pause & Partner * Where are we? Is anyone able to see their site live? It can take a few minutes to populate. * Who's lost? Turning in Your Assignments Your instructor will show you where and how to turn your assignments in using this live GitHub link as an example. Important Notes About Git and GitHub DON'T make changes to your code using the tools on GitHub like editing, deleting, creating, or uploading any files. Only make changes in your editor (VS Code) and push them up EVERY TIME. No exceptions. If you don't it may cause you some headaches. Git software is powerful but confusing for beginners. If something goes wrong while using git follow these steps: PLEASE DON'T delete your local folder with work in it that is not on GitHub. That is your precious time you are deleting! THIS IS WHY WE KEEP OUR CODE IN A REPO IN THE FIRST PLACE!! Check the branch you're on: git branch Change branches to see if the code you're looking for is on that branch: git checkout <NameOfBranch> Replace the \"broken\" folder with a new folder: Rename your folder on your computer web101_firstName_lastName to web101_firstName_lastName-broken Re-clone your repository from GitHub git clone https://github.com/username/ACA_web101_firstName_lastName.git Copy over all changed files from ACA_web101_firstName_lastName-broken folder into the new ACA_web101_firstName_lastName git add -A - Add all new files git status - See green git commit -m \"fixed my mess-up\" - to commit the changes git push origin main or master - push your code up to GitHub. ONLY AFTER you've confirmed that all changes are on GitHub, delete the broken repo folder. Student Presentation Organization Knowledge is best when it's learned not taught. In this program instructors and the learning portal guide the student's learning journey but our students own their learning experience. You'll be assigned to teach your classmates specific topics that are related to concepts and techniques being taught throughout the course and program. This process has been proven to deepen student's understanding, boost retention, and strengthen community and interpersonal communication skills.

When added to an element, it gives us control of how its child elements inside that element will be rendered. Take a look at the code snippets below and then check out the following screenshot to see if you can figure out how the flex value on the property display works before reading on. HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <!-- this section is the parent/container element --> < section class = \"truthful-statements\" > <!-- Each of these article elements are child elements/flex items --> < article > A connected life is the best life. </ article > < article > People have dogs. Some have cats. </ article > < article > Human activity is capturing heat at an alarming rate! </ article > </ section > CSS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /* the CSS to make it happen */ . truthful-statements { display : flex ; } article { border-color : blue ; border-style : solid ; border-width : 1 pt ; margin : 20 pt 5 pt ; padding : 2 pt 5 pt ; } Result You figure it out? If not, that's cool. Think about it like this: the flex value allows us to flexibly display child elements within a parent element. Unlike the inline and block values, flex doesn't do anything to the way the parent element is displayed in relation to its sibling elements. flex only changes the way its child elements are rendered inside of it. When we add flex to an element's display property, it comes with some other properties that can be tweaked, including these properties and their potential values: flex-direction - values include: row(the default), column & column-reverse flex-wrap - wrap (default), no-wrap, wrap-reverse justify-content - flex-start (default), center, end, space-between, space-evenly, stretch align-items - stretch (default), flex-start, center, baseline, flex-end align-content - stretch (default), center, flex-end, space-around, space-between NOTE: If you like using shorthand code you'll enjoy: flex-flow = flex-direction & flex-wrap Practice It: CSS Tricks - Flex Guide Try it !!

But if you've noticed, our elements still \"stack\" below each other one after another. This is the default behavior of HTML called Normal Document Flow . Elements will appear on screen as they are read in the HTML file: top-to-bottom-left-to-right. But what if we wanted to create a section on our page that had multiple element side by side? Like the you see below: In this example we have three images inside three \"containers\" which are inside a larger \"container\" that lays them out horizontally rather than vertically(like, normal document flow). Look again. In this screenshot we see a bunch of new boxes laid on top of the original screenshot. These boxes represent elements we would build in HTML.

This element is what we want to focus on because this one has the property we need to use to lay out child elements (the images and text below) horizontally rather than vertically. But before we get to making a flex ible display let's quickly cover this display property. The Display Property + Possible Values All HTML elements can be divided into categories based on their default value of this property! The two main values, and therefore categories, are block and inline . The default block elements are element that create an entire \"block across the screen and consequentially force other block elements to be on new separate lines, i.e. Normal Document Flow . Elements included in the category are Section, Article, Div, H1-H6, and P and a whole list more . Block elements are usually used to create structure on the page and generally have other elements, both inline and block, inside of them. If we were to write this property in CSS it would like like this: 1 2 3 . all-block-elements { display : block ; } NOTE: We don't have to declare the value of Block elements to be block elements because that's their default value. The other main category is inline elements. These are elements that don't require a new line so they can start in the middle of a P Element if you'd like. These elements include: Span, Anchor, Button, Code, Img, and Input elements but you can find the entire list at MDN Docs - Inline HTML Elements . Inline elements don't have space inside of them for other elements to go inside. And if we had to write this property in code it would look like this: 1 2 3 . all-inline-elements { display : inline ; } NOTE: Same as before, we don't have to declare this value because this is the default value. Only if we want to change this do we need to declare a new value. Another value you can use is none , as in display: none; . When you add JavaScript to your page you can change the visibility of an element based on a certain condition by using this value. But but what about the other possible values of the display property? Turns out there's a hybrid between the two main categories called inline-block . This value gives the associated element the flexibility of both properties allowing for it to act like an inline element where neighboring content will flow around it but still have the structure to hold child elements inside of it like a block element. NOTE: While you won't use this property often in the beginning you shouldn't forget about it because it will prove very useful when your building more creative web pages. Display: Flex; Beyond these newly discovered display values: inline , block , and inline-block there are a couple more value to learn: flex and grid .

As we move deeper in to these properties you'll notice a pattern emerge: properties of HTML Elements set by CSS come in groups because they are associated with each other. For instance, we've covered the Box Model Properties which include height , width , padding , border , and margin along with all of the sub-properties associated with each of them: margin-top , margin-bottom , padding-top , border-top , so forth and so forth. Soon you learn about the position property and the top and left together because they are associated with each other. Now we're in the Display Flex property/value with justify-content and flex-wrap and all the others. This pattern is important because it will help you learn faster and deeper! By now, you already have a good understanding HTML element just being objects with properties, methods, and events.

As you move forward trust that you have a good basis to build from and that you CAN learn these seemingly complicated technologies. You got this!! The Properties Items inside a \"Container\"/Parent Element with its display property set to flex are said to be flex items . When these items are rendered inside a flex display they get unique properties not available outside of the flex container. As you saw in the CSS Tricks Flex Guide they include: order - specifies the order of the flex items. You can tell the 3rd item to be the 1st item to be displayed. flex-grow - specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items. Items can be bigger than others. flex-shrink - how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. They can also be smaller! flex-basis - specifies the initial length of a flex item. Add as much as you like. align-self - specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container and overrides the align-items of the parent container. NOTE: Again, if you like shorthand (and don't mind less code readability), the flex property combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis into one. Practice It - Giphy Gallery Fork the Giphy Gallery - https://codepen.io/austincoding/pen/pozQRyQ Take a look at the HTML file. Can you find the <section class=\"row portrait-gallery\"> code on line 2? Inside this section you'll see three <img> elements. The <img> element has an attribute/property called src= , which stands for source, which is where the image comes from. In this case the images are coming from giphy.com . After that we see another attribute/property called alt= , which stands for alternate text. This is for people with blindness that can't see the image we put on the screen. It's important for you to create a descriptive alternate text for them to hear read to them. After that we see height= and width= which, of course, determine how big the images are. Go ahead and copy/paste this line: <img src=\"\" alt=\"what the image is\" height=\"360\" width=\"240\"> and add it into the <section> tag with the class name row gallery-two on line 7, so it looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 < section class = \"row gallery-two\" > <!-- Copy/Paste the line below for as many images as you'd like --> < img src = \"\" alt = \"what the image is\" height = \"360\" width = \"240\" > < img src = \"https://media.giphy.com/media/CBnvmgOvK1d9C/giphy.gif\" alt = \"what the image is\" height = \"360\" width = \"240\" > </ section > Use the suggested links below to copy/paste in between the \" \" of src=\"\" attribute: https://media.giphy.com/media/l1KVcrdl7rJpFnY2s/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGoQFXF7xdU6O7m/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/cJSjCgihYx9GqHXzDN/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/1rK68yfkG1Q8Aw87Lv/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/1xlqOpx8T0dlV3ZoHV/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohjV5W5NYvGnjJLTa/giphy.gif Remember to change the alt=\"\" value to describe the gif so that we meet 503 compliance.

You'll need the \"Gif Link\" NOT the \"Short Link\", \"HTML5 Video\" or \"Embed\" link to copy/paste in between the \" \" of the src=\"\" attribute. Now create a CSS rule for gallery-two on line 25 in the CSS file to make it flexible. 1 2 3 . gallery-two { display : flex ; } Do that again for the third row: gallery-three .

You got this!!","title":"Flex Item Properties"},{"location":"module-1/flexItemProperties/#the-properties","text":"Items inside a \"Container\"/Parent Element with its display property set to flex are said to be flex items . When these items are rendered inside a flex display they get unique properties not available outside of the flex container. As you saw in the CSS Tricks Flex Guide they include: order - specifies the order of the flex items. You can tell the 3rd item to be the 1st item to be displayed. flex-grow - specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items. Items can be bigger than others. flex-shrink - how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. They can also be smaller! flex-basis - specifies the initial length of a flex item. Add as much as you like. align-self - specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container and overrides the align-items of the parent container. NOTE: Again, if you like shorthand (and don't mind less code readability), the flex property combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis into one.","title":"The Properties"},{"location":"module-1/flexItemProperties/#practice-it-giphy-gallery","text":"Fork the Giphy Gallery - https://codepen.io/austincoding/pen/pozQRyQ Take a look at the HTML file. Can you find the <section class=\"row portrait-gallery\"> code on line 2? Inside this section you'll see three <img> elements. The <img> element has an attribute/property called src= , which stands for source, which is where the image comes from. In this case the images are coming from giphy.com . After that we see another attribute/property called alt= , which stands for alternate text. This is for people with blindness that can't see the image we put on the screen. It's important for you to create a descriptive alternate text for them to hear read to them. After that we see height= and width= which, of course, determine how big the images are. Go ahead and copy/paste this line: <img src=\"\" alt=\"what the image is\" height=\"360\" width=\"240\"> and add it into the <section> tag with the class name row gallery-two on line 7, so it looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 < section class = \"row gallery-two\" > <!-- Copy/Paste the line below for as many images as you'd like --> < img src = \"\" alt = \"what the image is\" height = \"360\" width = \"240\" > < img src = \"https://media.giphy.com/media/CBnvmgOvK1d9C/giphy.gif\" alt = \"what the image is\" height = \"360\" width = \"240\" > </ section > Use the suggested links below to copy/paste in between the \" \" of src=\"\" attribute: https://media.giphy.com/media/l1KVcrdl7rJpFnY2s/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGoQFXF7xdU6O7m/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/cJSjCgihYx9GqHXzDN/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/1rK68yfkG1Q8Aw87Lv/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/1xlqOpx8T0dlV3ZoHV/giphy.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohjV5W5NYvGnjJLTa/giphy.gif Remember to change the alt=\"\" value to describe the gif so that we meet 503 compliance. Repeat this a few times. NOTE: You can also go to giphy.com and find a gif you'd like to use. You'll need the \"Gif Link\" NOT the \"Short Link\", \"HTML5 Video\" or \"Embed\" link to copy/paste in between the \" \" of the src=\"\" attribute. Now create a CSS rule for gallery-two on line 25 in the CSS file to make it flexible. 1 2 3 . gallery-two { display : flex ; } Do that again for the third row: gallery-three . Once you have at least 9 total images, look at the ones you've added and compare them to the three you started with in the first row: row portrait-gallery . What's different? Why? Can you make them match? Change the order of your gifs. Can you -grow or -shrink your gifs?","title":"Practice It - Giphy Gallery"},{"location":"module-1/flexItemProperties/#practice-it-flex-box-froggy","text":"Now it's time to have some silly fun with serious results.

We mean models by the way we can understand how computers interact with the world around them. They don't see models or know about models, rather models are just ways we humans can conceptualize the way a computer keeps up with memory and transfers that information to other computers. Today we're going to learn about the \" CSS Box Model \" which is, put shortly, a model that helps us understand how to change the size, shape and overall appearance on an HTML element on the screen. Think, every element we put in our HTML code has a representation on the screen. That thing on the screen is just a box or rectangle. But with CSS we can change its properties to be taller, wider, centered, have a border and even change the shape to not be a box ... The box model properties used to change the appearance of our rectangles are: height min-height max-height width min-width max-width margin - (short-hand of the following 4 properties) margin-top margin-right margin-bottom margin-left border - (short-hand of the following 3 properties) border-style border-color border-width border-radius padding - (short-hand of the following 4 properties) padding-top padding-right padding-bottom padding-left The six properties listed above comprise most of the Box Model properties. There are, of course, many more properties that allow you very fine-tuned control over the shape and size of your elements . But for much of our lessons we won't have time to cover them all (you'll have to do that on your own time!). To help you understand how the short-hand properties (seen above) can represent all of the long hand properties, below are two CSS declarations that style a Section Element the exact same way. Notice the differences... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 section { background-color : #b1deef ; height : 200 px ; width : 200 px ; margin : 1 % auto ; padding : 5 % auto ; border : 1 px solid #264653 ; } The same properties could have been written this way, as well: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 section { background-color : #b1deef ; height : 200 px ; width : 200 px ; margin-top : 1 % ; margin-bottom : 1 % ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; padding-top : 5 % ; padding-top : 5 % ; padding-right : auto ; padding-left : auto ; border-width : 1 px ; border-style : solid ; border-color : #264653 ; } Did you pick it up?

Box Model Visualizer We'll definitely be re-visiting this visualizer but it may be a good introduction for you now. This CSS Box Model Visualizer is a nifty tool built by Caroline Artz to help people see how each property on the element effects the visual representation of the element on the screen. Each of the sliders are labeled with the actual properties you could type in CSS and the values you see are actual values you could code in CSS. And the changing box at the bottom right is what the element would look like. Try it! Box Model Visualizer In the upcoming lessons we'll dig a little deeper into the four categories of the CSS Box Model: Content Height & Width Margin Border Padding In addition to knowing the Box Model in your head, your browser's developer Tools offer a visualization of each element. Just open your browser's devtools, hover over an element, then click to select the element. In the DevTool Tray you should see the \"Elements\" Tab highlighted at the top-left and to the right you'll see two sub-tabs named \"Styles\" and \"Computed\". The \"Styles\" tab will list all of the CSS rules that are applied to that element including rules that are overridden (denoted by a strike-through). Under the \"Computed\" tab you'll see a box with colors of blue(content), green(padding), yellow(border), orange(margin) along with numbers indicating the value in pixels.
