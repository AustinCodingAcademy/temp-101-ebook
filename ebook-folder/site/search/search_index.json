By the end of the course, students will have built multiple static web pages and practiced the skills to build a functional static web page. These skills will transfer directly to the students\u2019 graduation app, completed in their 400 level course. In the students\u2019 200 level course, they will learn to program small applications before learning to structure data and serve it over the internet in their 300 level course. Class Structure and Expectations This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy! Due dates : Homework is due the Sunday after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE! Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the Submission Due Day , i.e. Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday. Assignments turned in after the Submission Due Day will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible. The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty. The Final Submission Day for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends. Assignments turned in after the Final Submission Day will receive an automatic grade of 50. Homework submission : Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Homework guidelines : Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete. Grading : You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment. Late policy : You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class. Exceptions : If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements. To Pass This Class (and all others) To pass Web 101 you will need to: Finish with a grade average of >70, Attend class 80% of the time, Complete your Final Checkpoint, Pitch to the class your idea of an app to build for your Capstone Project. Path to Success Students are expected to spend their weekends preparing for the next week of class by watching videos, reading tutorials, and working through examples. Additionally, there is a \"Career Readiness\" reading, video, or activity each week. Thus each week you will learn important skills that will help you secure employment upon completion of the course. Failure to complete the work outside of class will lead to failure in the class. Our philosophy is \"learn by doing\". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects in class. In these short eight weeks we have with you, we cannot possibly teach you everything there is to know about web development. You will not even learn it all in a career of web development. But we can hope to teach you to become an active learner, an engaged participant, an avid problem solver, and an enthusiastic entrepreneur in your learning journey which will soon become your career. We will lay out for you content that, if read, watched, practiced, and absorbed, will give you a strong foundation in learning every other skill needed to be a successful developer. We will give you challenges that if you face now will give you the know-how, the confidence and skills to tackle any challenge in the workplace. To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing every \"Pre-Homework\" assignment before class and continue to reference the assignment during and after class. Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own and bring their questions to class. Class begins by reviewing the \"Questions for Discussion\" of the \"Pre-Homework\", and the majority of class time is spent working on projects. Much of learning to code means understanding what is possible. You are not expected to memorize anything. The important thing is that you are able to ask the right questions to find answers and solve problems. Remember to use this book and every resource you come across, including your classmates, as you progress as a developer here and after school.

Class 6, 7, 8 Each of these class days, 33% of the class will teach the class about something they know well in less than 3 minutes. i.e. A special skill, talent or task, not coding/programming related. Class 9, 10, 11 Each of these class days, 33% of the class will pitch your graduation app idea to the class in less than 3 minutes. What\u2019s the problem? How does this app solve it? By the end of this Full-Stack Program you will have the tools to build a mobile app with a server, database, and a front-end app. To prove this to you, your family, and your future employers you will build an app of your design as a Capstone Project upon graduation. Think of it as your thesis for web development. You have enough experience now to start understanding what can be done and what you'd like to build as your Capstone Project. To get you started think of some task(s) you do often or a current hiccup in your daily routine or a wrinkle in some process you'd like smoothed out. Now start thinking of how this technology could solve those things. This is what you'll build. Make it personal to you so you build it with passion to get you through the tough times and the frustrations that will inevitably come as you build it. Next class you'll deliver your first pitch of this solution. Think of it as a practice in story-telling to people that are consciously-unaware of the problem knowing that once you present it to them, they will want the solution in their life! Your prompt is as follows.. In less than three mins: Present the problem to the class : \"Have you ever....\" present the problem to the class Offer a solution to the problem : \"But what if we had ....\" offer a solution to the problem Commit yourself to the solution: : \"I am building this very ....\" commit yourself to the solution Then be prepared for questions from your classmates and instructor. Organize it!! The instructor will take a few minutes now to divide students up similarly to the way your last round of presentations have been with 3 students presenting each class for the next 6 classes, starting next class.

In fact, all HTML Elements have a border but have a default value of null , meaning you won't see them (See, Default CSS Values Reference ).

New Length Units By default, the dimension of an element is the size of the content contained within the element. This means that when you create an <article> element it won't have a height that you can see on the screen because there is nothing inside of it. But as soon as you add content you'll be able to see it grow to fit the amount of content. We can, of course, make the element larger than the content by changing its width and height properties. The width and height properties take the traditional px (pixel) unit like the other properties you've read about so far, but now we'll throw a curve ball at you: All of the properties you've read about take far more length units than just the traditional px , including: in , cm , mm , em , rem , vh , vw , % , pt and many more. \"Why so many?\" That's a good question that doesn't really need to be answered right now. Suffice it to say that there have been many additions to the CSS language trying to accommodate for designers working on computers. The ones I'd like you to focus your attention on right now are % and pt . Percentage is Dynamic % , or percentage , tells the child element to be displayed at a specified percentage, or proportion, of its parent element. Check out the example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <!-- index.html file --> < article > < p > The red fox jumped over the green turtle. </ p > </ article > < style > /* style.css file */ article { width : 500 px ; height : 600 px ; } article > p { width : 90 % ; height : 50 % ; } </ style > In the example above, the <article> element, or parent element, will be 500px by 600px while the <p> element, or child element, will be rendered at 450px( 90% ) by 300px( 50% ) because it is set to be a percentage of its parent element. This is really useful when parent elements are set to be sized in proportion to their parent element like maybe . . . <body> . See the example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 <!-- index.html file --> < article > < p > The red fox jumped over the green turtle. </ p > </ article > < style > /* style.css file */ /* The <body> element will be automatically set to the height and width of the viewport, or display of the computer, tablet, or phone's window */ body { width : auto ; height : auto ; } /* Then the <article> element will be set to 50% as wide as the whole <body> and 100% as tall as the <body> */ article { width : 50 % ; height : 100 % ; } /* Can I assume you can guess what the paragraph element will do? */ article > p { width : 90 % ; height : 50 % ; } </ style > Using percentages is advantageous because you will never know all the sizes of screens that will view your web pages; this way you can tell elements to be a specific percentage of the available area instead of hard coded pixels! Follow It Up with Min- & Max- When using percentages as values it's important to include the min-width / max-width and min-height / max-height properties so as to avoid your elements being rendered in sizes that are unmanageable for the user. See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 body { width : auto ; height : auto ; min-width : 100 pt ; /* <--- Notice the use of the pt unit */ max-width : 1000 pt ; min-height : 150 pt ; max-height : 1500 pt ; } Above you saw the use of pt or points . These are a little more reliable than px which are relative to the number of pixels in a user's display and other factors . The pt value is equal to 1/72nd of an inch so you can calculate a little more easily the size of your elements. View-height & View-Width The last units you should know about are vh and vw which stand for view-height and view-width , respectively. These are very useful units except for the fact that they are not supported on all previous versions of mobile browsers.

Names? 3 mins - Now turn the opposite way and find another collaborator. Ask them these questions: What's your name? Tell me about an interesting book or article you've read lately? What do you think about when you watch the stars? What is a dream of yours you are willing to work toward and figure out how to bring it to fruition? 3 mins - Last time, get up and walk to the other side of the classroom to find a different colleague to ask them these questions: What's your name? What's your Zodiac sign? What daily self-care methods do you practice to maintain good health? What is a fear you have about this course? How do you plan to overcome it? 15 mins - Show-And-Tell , Finally, stop where you are, turn toward the rest of the class, and as you feel the need, raise your hand to introduce your new (last/most recent) friend to the class. Example: \"Hello, my friend, James, is a Libra, born Oct 15th. He says that journaling, drinking water, and running help him sleep soundly and have bright useful days. He's nervous that he doesn't know computers well enough but he thinks if he keeps reading, breathing, and resting his mind he can stay focused on the marathon and not just the dash!\" Everyone should introduce their new friend. Now that we know each other let's sit down and get to work! Questions for Student Led Discussion, 35 mins Questions to prompt discussion Accounts, Downloads, and Git Software Check-In, 30 minutes In this section we'll take things step at a time with time to slow down and get help, we'll call them Pause and Partner where students that were successful in the steps will partner with students that weren't to help them through any troubles. This will help conserve class time so your instructor can teach thing everyone needs to learn. We'll be using these two programs tonight and for the rest of class. If you didn't get both of them downloaded and opened up, ask your new friends if they did so they can help you out. The IDE : Visual Studio Code Plus the extension: Live-Server The version control software: Git For Windows: How To Install Git on Windows Install Git For Mac: Install HomeBrew - /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\" Install Git - brew install git NOTE: (There is no icon for this program, just go to your terminal/shell/commandPrompt/bash and type git + ENTER) Pause and Partner: Did anyone NOT get these downloaded? Did anyone not get them opened? Partner up and help each other. Create a Repo on GitHub First, Sign-in to GitHub. At the top-right of the screen click on the \"+\" icon and select \"New Repository\" In the \"Repository Name\" field type: web101_firstName_lastName NOTE: remember to change firstName for your actual first name and lastName for your actual last name. In the \"Description field\" type: \"This is my portfolio website!\" Make it \"Public\" by clicking the radio button next to Public. So your instructor can view it. Check the box to \"Initialize this repository with a README.md\" NOTE: This is a file we'll use later on and you'll understand why it's important to use later on. Click \"Create Repository\". After this you should see a screen that looks like this: Find your Portfolio Folder in the terminal by either: dragging and dropping the folder in the terminal Use the command cd to change directories until you're inside the folder. Type pwd to confirm your in the correct folder. Then use these commands one after another. They're modified a little from the image above. git init - this will initialize the folder as a folder for the git software to watch. git add -A - this adds all the files you created for your Portfolio Landing Page. git commit -m \"first commit\" - This stages your new files to be added to the remote remote, you're \"committing\" to the changes. git branch -M main - GitHub recently changed the name of the \"main\" branch from master to main . This command ensure you're using main as your \"main\" branch. git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/web101-firstName_lastName.git - Attaches the remote repo to this local folder. NOTE: be sure you replace the link wit the link given to YOU from gitHub. git push -u origin main - pushes your committed files up to the remote repo. Watch the progress in your terminal then refresh the tab with your GitHub Repo to see if the files are there. In your terminal you're looking for feedback that looks like this: Pause and Partner: What problems have you encountered? Is there anyone that was rejected by GitHub? Password? Username? Let's partner up according to our problems and help each other get through them! Who's successful and who is struggling? Follow-Up Video: Creating a Repo and Using Git Is anyone having a trouble push ing? Maybe your configurations aren't set correctly. See next section: Git Configurations NOTE: Mac users can learn to setup the code . path for VS Code in this video. Git Configurations When you're pushing code to a repo, Git needs to know who you are so it can sign-in to GitHub. It uses your username/email and password to do this. If you don't setup this configuration, git will populate your email with an address assigned to your computer that doesn't match your account on GitHub. NOTE: if while doing these steps you'll see a strange looking screen pop up, it might be your computer's default text editor, VIM or VI . Just follow the instructions below and/or watch the video to use it. Set up Git Config(urations) All Machine Users Set your git username. In your terminal, copy/paste this code and replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username: git config --global user.name \"YOUR-USERNAME\" + ENTER Now, set your email. In your terminal, copy/paste this code and replace YOUR EMAIL with the email you used to create your GitHub account: git config --global user.email \"YOURemail@address.com\" + ENTER Note: If it asks you for a password this is your GitHub account password VIM/VI - How to Use It When doing your git config you may see a more unusual window in your terminal. it will have a bunch of ~ or # along the left side. This is a built-in text editor like VS Code but very stripped down. It allows you to change files and write code. For this step you'll be changing your .gitconfig file to contain your username and email. VIM has two modes: Insert (input text) and Command (move around and do stuff). For now, we really only need to insert text, but you'll need to know how to get in and out of the two different modes. To start the Insert Mode : Press i to enter Insert mode and press esc to begin Command mode . You'll know which one you're in because \"insert\" will appear at the bottom of the screen when you enter insert mode. While Command Mode is active you navigate around the page with your arrow keys (d-pad). When you need to type in your email or anything else, press i . You're then free to type in whatever you need. In this .gitconfig file all lines that begin with # are read as \"comments\" meaning the computer doesn't read them. Make sure you remove them from the important lines. Ask your instructor. When you're finished inserting, press esc to move back to Command mode . Then to exit and save the file type :wq + ENTER. This simply says to the computer: \"I'm about to give you a command( : ), write the file( w ) then quit the program( q ).\" NOTE: If you're lost, it's totally fine. VIM is an old relic that's stuck around and become a hipster text editor but really it's there so you can always change files, no matter what! If you're having trouble: Git Config How-To Video Pause and Partner: How we doing? Try git push ing again. Who hasn't been able to push? Practice It Again: Add A file and Push It Now that you've configured your git software and learned the status , add , commit , push process, let's practice using git again. Create another file in the same directory called: .gitignore . Then copy/paste this code into that file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 ### macOS ### # General .DS_Store .AppleDouble .LSOverride # Icon must end with two \\r Icon # Thumbnails ._* # Files that might appear in the root of a volume .DocumentRevisions-V100 .fseventsd .Spotlight-V100 .TemporaryItems .Trashes .VolumeIcon.icns .com.apple.timemachine.donotpresent # Directories potentially created on remote AFP share .AppleDB .AppleDesktop Network Trash Folder Temporary Items .apdisk ### Windows ### # Windows thumbnail cache files Thumbs.db Thumbs.db:encryptable ehthumbs.db ehthumbs_vista.db # Dump file *.stackdump # Folder config file [Dd]esktop.ini # Recycle Bin used on file shares $RECYCLE.BIN/ # Windows Installer files *.cab *.msi *.msix *.msm *.msp # Windows shortcuts *.lnk # Sensitive Environment Variables .env # VS CODE .vscode/settings.json # End of https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/macos,windows NOTE: This step is mainly for Mac users but really all users should know how to use .gitignore which is a file that git software looks for and will ignore whatever you write inside of it. Its good practice to include this file with all projects you do in the future. To move this file up to your remote repo by running these commands in order: git status - check to see what files you've changed and that you hit \"SAVE\" git add .gitignore - Adds the changed file to the staging area. git commit -m \"to git to ignore certain files\" - Commits the file changes with a descriptive message about the changes made. git push - pushes the change from the staging area to the remote repo. Make a note for yourself!! Every time you make substantial changes to your code bases you'll run these commands in this order EVERYTIME! Pause & Partner : How we doing? Any questions about these four commands? Who didn't get this .gitignore file into their repo? Serve Your Landing Page Now that your web page is hosted on a publicly available computer, GitHub's server, you can change the permissions and allow for it to seen by the world! Go back to the repo you just created on GitHub then go to the \"Settings Tab\". Under the Settings, scroll down almost to the bottom of the page until you see \"GitHub Pages\". Click the None dropdown and select main branch and then click \"Save\". Now, scroll back down to the \"GitHub Pages\" section and you'll see a section that says \"Your site is ready to be published at https://yourusername.github.io/ .\" - This is the ROOT of your live site. In order to see your live site, you need to put in the rest of the URL's path . Use your browser to navigate to: https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/ACA_web101_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME/myPortfolio/index.html NOTE: Do you see how the forward-slashes / in the URL look the exact same as the path names in our <link/> tags? That's because server-computers hold files the same way your personal computer does and the structure of the directories are the same, i.e. the current path to your portfolio looks like: documents/DevFolder/myPortfolio/index.html . All computers are built the same way and talk the same way. Pause & Partner * Where are we? Is anyone able to see their site live? It can take a few minutes to populate. * Who's lost? Turning in Your Assignments Your instructor will show you where and how to turn your assignments in using this live GitHub link as an example. Important Notes About Git and GitHub DON'T make changes to your code using the tools on GitHub like editing, deleting, creating, or uploading any files. Only make changes in your editor (VS Code) and push them up EVERY TIME. No exceptions. If you don't it may cause you some headaches. Git software is powerful but confusing for beginners. If something goes wrong while using git follow these steps: PLEASE DON'T delete your local folder with work in it that is not on GitHub. That is your precious time you are deleting! THIS IS WHY WE KEEP OUR CODE IN A REPO IN THE FIRST PLACE!! Check the branch you're on: git branch Change branches to see if the code you're looking for is on that branch: git checkout <NameOfBranch> Replace the \"broken\" folder with a new folder: Rename your folder on your computer web101_firstName_lastName to web101_firstName_lastName-broken Re-clone your repository from GitHub git clone https://github.com/username/ACA_web101_firstName_lastName.git Copy over all changed files from ACA_web101_firstName_lastName-broken folder into the new ACA_web101_firstName_lastName git add -A - Add all new files git status - See green git commit -m \"fixed my mess-up\" - to commit the changes git push origin main or master - push your code up to GitHub. ONLY AFTER you've confirmed that all changes are on GitHub, delete the broken repo folder. Student Presentation Organization Knowledge is best when it's learned not taught.

The code for one of these products might look something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 <!-- shop.html --> < article > < div class = \"item-banner\" > < button onclick = \"savePin(this)\" >< img src = \"./images/pic-tac.png\" ></ button > < span class = \"sale\" >< img src = \"./images/sale-tag.png\" ></ span > </ div > < img src = \"./images/amet-lipstick.png\" /> < div class = \"item-description-price\" > < h3 > Amet Lipstick </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > And some of the CSS might look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /* shop-styles.css */ . item-banner { display : flex ; background : transparent ; margin-bottom : -5 % ; /*approximate*/ } /* more CSS Code here */ . sale-price { text-decoration : line-through ; } To create the other two products we could copy/paste the HTML we see above and change out the values, BUT, that would only stack them below each other like all the other web pages we've built. In our next project we want to lay the items out horizontally like this screenshot. To do this we would need to \"wrap\" all of these items inside a \"container\" elements that can control the flow of the element. In this example we'll use a Section element: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 <!-- shop.html --> <!-- ...more code here... --> < section > <!-- this element \"wraps\" around the other elements and becomes the \"container\", or Parent Element --> < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > Amet Lipstick </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > Aps Lipstick </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > BB Cream </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > </ section > The CSS to make it work looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 /* shop-style.css */ section { display : flex ; justify-content : space - evenly ; } How Does Flex Work See, flex , formally known as: flexbox, is a value that can be given to the display property on any block element that would normally contain other elements, i.e. section, article, footer, header, nav. When added to an element, it gives us control of how its child elements inside that element will be rendered. Take a look at the code snippets below and then check out the following screenshot to see if you can figure out how the flex value on the property display works before reading on. HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <!-- this section is the parent/container element --> < section class = \"truthful-statements\" > <!-- Each of these article elements are child elements/flex items --> < article > A connected life is the best life. </ article > < article > People have dogs. Some have cats. </ article > < article > Human activity is capturing heat at an alarming rate! </ article > </ section > CSS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /* the CSS to make it happen */ . truthful-statements { display : flex ; } article { border-color : blue ; border-style : solid ; border-width : 1 pt ; margin : 20 pt 5 pt ; padding : 2 pt 5 pt ; } Result You figure it out? If not, that's cool. Think about it like this: the flex value allows us to flexibly display child elements within a parent element. Unlike the inline and block values, flex doesn't do anything to the way the parent element is displayed in relation to its sibling elements. flex only changes the way its child elements are rendered inside of it. When we add flex to an element's display property, it comes with some other properties that can be tweaked, including these properties and their potential values: flex-direction - values include: row(the default), column & column-reverse flex-wrap - wrap (default), no-wrap, wrap-reverse justify-content - flex-start (default), center, end, space-between, space-evenly, stretch align-items - stretch (default), flex-start, center, baseline, flex-end align-content - stretch (default), center, flex-end, space-around, space-between NOTE: If you like using shorthand code you'll enjoy: flex-flow = flex-direction & flex-wrap Practice It: CSS Tricks - Flex Guide Try it !! Go to CodePen and create Section element to be your \"Flex\" Container. Then create three Article elements inside of it: 1 2 3 4 5 < section class = \"my-flex-container\" > < article class = \"square-one\" ></ article > < article class = \"square-two\" ></ article > < article class = \"square-three\" ></ article > < section > Then use the CSS snippet you see above but apply it to the class: .my-flex-container . Then size all of your articles to be just simple square blocks: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 . my-flex-container { border : 5 pt solid EE621F ; display : flex ; } article { border : 5 pt solid #FDEFE1 ; height : 144 pt ; width : 144 pt ; } /* Just for fun ;) */ article : hover { border-color : #EE2D7A ; border-style : dotted ; } Now open up this website, A Complete Guide to Flex(box) . This website will be your guide in flex display from here until the end of time so you might as well get familiar with it now. On the left side of the guide you'll see all the properties that can be given to the Parent Element, The \"Container\" element. Start with flex-direction and work through all the values of flex-direction . Then move on to flex-wrap and do the same thing. Then move on to justify-content , and so forth and so forth. Do NOT move on until you've worked through all the properties available to the display container. In the next lesson we'll cover the properties for items of a \"Container\" element.

In our next project we want to lay the items out horizontally like this screenshot. To do this we would need to \"wrap\" all of these items inside a \"container\" elements that can control the flow of the element. In this example we'll use a Section element: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 <!-- shop.html --> <!-- ...more code here... --> < section > <!-- this element \"wraps\" around the other elements and becomes the \"container\", or Parent Element --> < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > Amet Lipstick </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > Aps Lipstick </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > < article > < div > <!-- ...more code here... --> < h3 > BB Cream </ h3 > < p >< span class = \"sale-price\" > \u00a340.00 </ span > \u00a328.00 </ p > </ div > </ article > </ section > The CSS to make it work looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 /* shop-style.css */ section { display : flex ; justify-content : space - evenly ; }","title":"Flex and Relevant Properties"},{"location":"module-1/displayFlexProperties/#how-does-flex-work","text":"See, flex , formally known as: flexbox, is a value that can be given to the display property on any block element that would normally contain other elements, i.e. section, article, footer, header, nav. When added to an element, it gives us control of how its child elements inside that element will be rendered. Take a look at the code snippets below and then check out the following screenshot to see if you can figure out how the flex value on the property display works before reading on. HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <!-- this section is the parent/container element --> < section class = \"truthful-statements\" > <!-- Each of these article elements are child elements/flex items --> < article > A connected life is the best life. </ article > < article > People have dogs. Some have cats. </ article > < article > Human activity is capturing heat at an alarming rate! </ article > </ section > CSS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /* the CSS to make it happen */ . truthful-statements { display : flex ; } article { border-color : blue ; border-style : solid ; border-width : 1 pt ; margin : 20 pt 5 pt ; padding : 2 pt 5 pt ; } Result You figure it out? If not, that's cool. Think about it like this: the flex value allows us to flexibly display child elements within a parent element. Unlike the inline and block values, flex doesn't do anything to the way the parent element is displayed in relation to its sibling elements. flex only changes the way its child elements are rendered inside of it. When we add flex to an element's display property, it comes with some other properties that can be tweaked, including these properties and their potential values: flex-direction - values include: row(the default), column & column-reverse flex-wrap - wrap (default), no-wrap, wrap-reverse justify-content - flex-start (default), center, end, space-between, space-evenly, stretch align-items - stretch (default), flex-start, center, baseline, flex-end align-content - stretch (default), center, flex-end, space-around, space-between NOTE: If you like using shorthand code you'll enjoy: flex-flow = flex-direction & flex-wrap","title":"How Does Flex Work"},{"location":"module-1/displayFlexProperties/#practice-it-css-tricks-flex-guide","text":"Try it !!

Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring ** Overview Now that wireframing is fresh on your mind and you're thinking about the way websites get planned and laid out let's introduce a new tool that will help you code these well designed websites, CSS Grid. Grids are used all over the place : spreadsheets, shelves, cities, and even art paintings. If you've ever thought about the way newspapers, books, magazines, or in-general: print work is laid out, they use a grid to structure composition. Over time, the grid was brought over to the web because again, our whole society shifted from print to digital media. When we begin building a website, laying out the overall structure is the first thing we do. It's like framing a house before deciding which wallpaper we'll put in. The skeleton of the page is, undoubtedly, the first part you should arrange every time you work on a project. Therefore, it is only fitting that we introduce it, sooner rather than later. Let's get to it. Like CSS Flex, CSS Grid is a value in CSS we can assign to the display property of an HTML element to lay out our page in a specific way. Once we've applied the grid value to the display property, you can then use columns and rows to layout the Child Element within the selected Parent Element. This is a really useful way to lay out your page quickly and sustainably. With the exception of the CSS Grid properties you see in the code given to you for your Portfolio Landing Page, you've been working with elements that stack below one another, due to normal document flow. But, as you know, typical websites have multiple elements across the screen and not just stacked on top of one another. This can be done with the value: flex given to the property display of the element we want. Let's dig into that. Remember that each of the elements in an HTML file have many properties behind them that we can access with CSS and JavaScript(JS). One of these properties is the display property. Through it we can change the way the element is rendered on the screen and how its child elements are arranged within it. See It - Display: Grid To set an area of your webpage as a grid to layout out other elements on, just give it the property & value: display: grid;. Let's say we want our <body/> element to have a grid, simply select the body in your CSS file and set the property display to grid like so: 1 2 3 body { display : grid ; } Easy. Right? From here on, we'll refer to our body element as our Grid Container . You will need one of these Parent Grid Containers every time you would like to arrange elements, or Grid Items , just the same way you use a Flexible Box Container for flexed items. Grid Template Properties After that you'll need to set up the number of columns, grid-template-columns , and rows, grid-template-rows , you desire in the Grid Container. Let's say we want our body to have 2 equally sized columns and 4 equally sized rows: 1 2 3 4 5 body { display : grid ; grid-template-columns : 50 % 50 % ; grid-template-rows : 25 % 25 % 25 % 25 % ; } Do you see how we assigned multiple values to grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows ? The number of values we assign equals the number of columns or rows and the percentage represent how much space they'll take up. NOTE: Make sure your percentages add up to 100%. Now our body element will have a grid with two columns that are 50% of the display wide and 4 rows that are each 25% of the total display's height. Now we can place our Grid Items inside the Grid Container. Lets say we want our HTML element, maybe a <section> element, with the class name: our-grid-item , to be positioned at the bottom-right corner of our grid (in the last row of the right column). Take a look at the HTML and CSS snippets below and then the resulting screenshots the follows. Try it yourself ! index.html 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <!-- ...more HTML code here... --> < link href = \"./index-style.css\" /> <!-- ...more HTML code here... --> < body > < section class = \"our-grid-item\" > Know thyself. You're all you'll ever have. </ section > </ body > index-style.css 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 body { display : grid ; grid-template-columns : 50 % 50 % ; grid-template-rows : 25 % 25 % 25 % 25 % ; width : 500 pt ; /* Add some dimension and color for us to see it better */ height : 500 pt ; border : solid red 1 pt ; } . our-grid-item { grid-column : 2 / 3 ; grid-row : 4 / 5 ; border : solid black 2 pt ; /* add color and dimension to see more easily */ margin : 20 pt 5 pt ; padding : 2 pt 5 pt ; } Result Do you see that?

We use the property grid-column on the Grid Item and give it the value we want the element to start at and end on separated by a / . This tells the browser to find the line in the grid you specified on the left-side of the / and end on the number you gave on the right-side.

But if you've noticed, our elements still \"stack\" below each other one after another. This is the default behavior of HTML called Normal Document Flow . Elements will appear on screen as they are read in the HTML file: top-to-bottom-left-to-right. But what if we wanted to create a section on our page that had multiple element side by side? Like the you see below: In this example we have three images inside three \"containers\" which are inside a larger \"container\" that lays them out horizontally rather than vertically(like, normal document flow). Look again. In this screenshot we see a bunch of new boxes laid on top of the original screenshot. These boxes represent elements we would build in HTML. We use these wireframes to help us navigate the composition and construction of a web page. For now, notice the largest teal colored rectangle labeled <section style=\"display: flex;\"> . This element is what we want to focus on because this one has the property we need to use to lay out child elements (the images and text below) horizontally rather than vertically. But before we get to making a flex ible display let's quickly cover this display property. The Display Property + Possible Values All HTML elements can be divided into categories based on their default value of this property! The two main values, and therefore categories, are block and inline . The default block elements are element that create an entire \"block across the screen and consequentially force other block elements to be on new separate lines, i.e. Normal Document Flow . Elements included in the category are Section, Article, Div, H1-H6, and P and a whole list more . Block elements are usually used to create structure on the page and generally have other elements, both inline and block, inside of them. If we were to write this property in CSS it would like like this: 1 2 3 . all-block-elements { display : block ; } NOTE: We don't have to declare the value of Block elements to be block elements because that's their default value. The other main category is inline elements. These are elements that don't require a new line so they can start in the middle of a P Element if you'd like. These elements include: Span, Anchor, Button, Code, Img, and Input elements but you can find the entire list at MDN Docs - Inline HTML Elements . Inline elements don't have space inside of them for other elements to go inside. And if we had to write this property in code it would look like this: 1 2 3 . all-inline-elements { display : inline ; } NOTE: Same as before, we don't have to declare this value because this is the default value. Only if we want to change this do we need to declare a new value. Another value you can use is none , as in display: none; . When you add JavaScript to your page you can change the visibility of an element based on a certain condition by using this value. But but what about the other possible values of the display property? Turns out there's a hybrid between the two main categories called inline-block . This value gives the associated element the flexibility of both properties allowing for it to act like an inline element where neighboring content will flow around it but still have the structure to hold child elements inside of it like a block element. NOTE: While you won't use this property often in the beginning you shouldn't forget about it because it will prove very useful when your building more creative web pages. Display: Flex; Beyond these newly discovered display values: inline , block , and inline-block there are a couple more value to learn: flex and grid . Within each are inline-flex , inline-grid , so forth. For this next lesson we'll learn about flex and its relevant properties. We'll get grid after our next class!

As we move deeper in to these properties you'll notice a pattern emerge: properties of HTML Elements set by CSS come in groups because they are associated with each other. For instance, we've covered the Box Model Properties which include height , width , padding , border , and margin along with all of the sub-properties associated with each of them: margin-top , margin-bottom , padding-top , border-top , so forth and so forth. Soon you learn about the position property and the top and left together because they are associated with each other. Now we're in the Display Flex property/value with justify-content and flex-wrap and all the others. This pattern is important because it will help you learn faster and deeper! By now, you already have a good understanding HTML element just being objects with properties, methods, and events. You know that JS functions can be triggered by an event on an element like onclick and that methods are just built in functions that we don't have to write ourselves. As you move forward trust that you have a good basis to build from and that you CAN learn these seemingly complicated technologies. You got this!! The Properties Items inside a \"Container\"/Parent Element with its display property set to flex are said to be flex items . When these items are rendered inside a flex display they get unique properties not available outside of the flex container. As you saw in the CSS Tricks Flex Guide they include: order - specifies the order of the flex items. You can tell the 3rd item to be the 1st item to be displayed. flex-grow - specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items. Items can be bigger than others. flex-shrink - how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. They can also be smaller! flex-basis - specifies the initial length of a flex item. Add as much as you like. align-self - specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container and overrides the align-items of the parent container. NOTE: Again, if you like shorthand (and don't mind less code readability), the flex property combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis into one. Practice It - Giphy Gallery Fork the Giphy Gallery - https://codepen.io/austincoding/pen/pozQRyQ Take a look at the HTML file. Can you find the <section class=\"row portrait-gallery\"> code on line 2? Inside this section you'll see three <img> elements. The <img> element has an attribute/property called src= , which stands for source, which is where the image comes from. In this case the images are coming from giphy.com .

As we move deeper in to these properties you'll notice a pattern emerge: properties of HTML Elements set by CSS come in groups because they are associated with each other. For instance, we've covered the Box Model Properties which include height , width , padding , border , and margin along with all of the sub-properties associated with each of them: margin-top , margin-bottom , padding-top , border-top , so forth and so forth. Soon you learn about the position property and the top and left together because they are associated with each other. Now we're in the Display Flex property/value with justify-content and flex-wrap and all the others. This pattern is important because it will help you learn faster and deeper! By now, you already have a good understanding HTML element just being objects with properties, methods, and events. You know that JS functions can be triggered by an event on an element like onclick and that methods are just built in functions that we don't have to write ourselves.

You can tell the 3rd item to be the 1st item to be displayed. flex-grow - specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items. Items can be bigger than others. flex-shrink - how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. They can also be smaller! flex-basis - specifies the initial length of a flex item. Add as much as you like. align-self - specifies the alignment for the selected item inside the flexible container and overrides the align-items of the parent container.

Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be.\u201d \u2015Shel Silverstein Overview Today we're going to spend some solid time on how to select the right element in your HTML file so you can style and manipulate to your pleasure. NOTE: This can be a little trickier than you may first realize. Remember the \"Cascade\"? In this lesson, we're going to talk a little more about that and learn how to get to exactly the element on the document we want! Today you'll learn to: 1. Reference elements by selectors and why you'd use different selectors. 1. Select and style an element based on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. 1. Implement inheritance and learn to work with it using the Rules of Specificity. The Selectors The reason for all the many selectors is because of the way the DOM is built under-the-hood. As the browser loads your HTML it reserves space for each of the elements in the file, then assigns them properties and values based on what it finds in your CSS and JS files. As it does this it will rewrite those values when it finds a new value assignment, but... if no property & value is found for each child elements during the build, they will Inherit the properties & values of their Parent Elements. This process of Inheriting and reassigning values as the page is built is the Cascade of C ascading S tyle S heets. But the Cascade can be overwritten using the Rules of Specificity , hence why we need so many selectors. The 5 Main of Selectors ids - This is added inside the element's opening tag and denoted with a \"#\". html <article id=\"element_ID\"> text goes here </article> classes - This is denoted by the keyword: class=\"someClassNameHere\" html <article class=\"element_class\"> text goes here </article> attributes - <input disabled > For a full list of HTML attributes . pseudo-classes are selectors used on an element when something is done to them like when you hover over an element with your cursor: :hover { } Type Selector index.html 1 < a href = \"https://google.com\" > Google </ a > index-style.css 1 2 3 4 a { /* removes the underline */ text-decoration : none ; } This selector is useful at saving you typing time by setting generic rules for all of your <p> tags, or all of your <section> tags so that they all have the same general style, but then you can give them a class name or id when you want each one to look/do something different than the other <p> and <section> tag. id Selector The id selector is used for a unique element, which means that an id should only be used one time, on one element, per page. Simply add an id attribute and a value. index.html 1 2 < div id = \"mario\" ></ div > < div id = \"wario\" ></ div > index-style.css 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # mario { color : red ; } # wario { color : yellow ; } You should only use an id once but you can use multiple ids on a page. Class Selector The class selector is very similar to the id selector, but class can be shared with more elements. You can apply classes multiple times on a page to any element you want. index.html 1 2 3 < div class = \"luigi\" ></ div > < div ></ div > < div class = \"luigi\" ></ div > index-style.css 1 2 3 . luigi { color : green ; } Attribute Selector You are not restricted to the two attributes, class and id. You can specify other element-specific attributes by using [square brackets] . Inside the brackets you put the attribute name, optionally followed by a matching operator and a value. index.html 1 2 < a disabled > I'm a disabled link! </ a > < input type = \"button\" > index-style.css 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 [ disabled ] { color : gray ; } [ type = \"button\" ] { font-size : 16 px ; } Psuedo-class Selectors A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to one of the selectors covered above that specifies a special characteristic or state of the element you're selecting. For example :hover will apply a style when the user's cursor hovers over the element specified by the selector. You won't see these special state attributes explicitly written in HTML, but they are present nonetheless, as Element Properties ready to be manipulated using CSS. 1 2 3 4 /* The Syntax looks like this: */ selector : pseudo-class { property : value ; } index.html 1 < section ></ section > index-style.css 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 section { display : block ; background-color : blue ; } section : focus { background-color : yellow ; } Practice It - Common CSS Selectors Fork the CSS Selector CodePen Give every other <li> element the class name \"other\" Make the font color of \"other\" brown . Make the font style of \"other verdana . Give different id attributes to each of the <p> elements. Use the id s to give them different background colors. Select the body element an get the text to be centered in the middle of the page.

It's almost ridiculous to mention the need for these layouts because we see it all over the place but its important to remember, that everything you see on the web was built by someone, just like you that learned the same thing you're learning now. Again, front-end developers are responsible for building all the possible views for a website or web app so let's figure out the best ways do this. Grid Areas Along with being an introduction to responsive design, we'll also be getting a deeper dive into CSS Grid by studying grid-template-areas . If you didn't get that far in your latest pre-class lessons, here you go. This property is an incredibly powerful property to use with display: grid ; because it allows you to shuffle child elements around by just changing the value assigned to the grid-template-areas property! If you can imagine, this will make it very easy for us to develop a view for a phone and then a tablet and then a laptop! Before moving ahead, I'd like you to read this short article on Grid-Template-Areas . When you finish, come back and follow along with the examples below. I'll wait... Grid Areas Part One First, let's layout our elements in HTML. We'll create a body element with the class name container so we know that it will be our parent element for this page. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 < body class = \"container\" > < header > header </ header > < nav > < ul > < li >< a href = \"#\" > nav 1 </ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"#\" > nav 2 </ a ></ li > < li >< a href = \"#\" > nav 3 </ a ></ li > </ ul > </ nav > < main > < h1 > Main Title </ h1 > < p > Main content </ p > </ main > < aside > aside </ aside > < div class = \"banner\" > div.banner </ div > < footer > footer </ footer > </ body > In our CSS file we declare each child element's grid-area property with a value we deem to be useful, i.e. the <nav></nav> element should get grid-area: nav; . NOTE: The name we pass in as the value will be used to arrange the elements when we get back to changing the CSS rules of our parent element. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 header { /* give each element some color to see more easily */ background-color : bisque ; /* notice this property on each rule, though, we'll use it when we're laying out the Parent Element's grid-template-area */ grid-area : header ; } main { background-color : cadetblue ; grid-area : main ; } nav { background-color : coral ; grid-area : nav ; } aside { background-color : crimson ; grid-area : aside ; } . banner { background-color : darkkhaki ; grid-area : banner ; } footer { background-color : darkslategrey ; grid-area : footer ; } Fantastic! Now each of our child elements have a name we can reference them by when we tell them where to be in the \"template-area\". In this next snippet, look at the number of -columns and -rows we create and then checkout the grid-template-areas property. Do you see the way we use the \"names\" of the child elements to position them on the screen? NOTE: to play with this for yourself, copy/paste these code snippets into a CodePen or your text editor. This is your responsibility and privilege now.

NOTE: the ... you see in the code stand for \"blank\" space on the screen. You saw this in the first example too: \"... banner ...\" .

Practice It - CSS Grid Areas Responsive CodePen Open the CodePen up and resize your browser's window while watching the content at the bottom of the screen. Fork the CodePen and then try rearranging the grid-areas. Have fun. Seriously! Can you guess how Media Queries work before the next lesson? Nested Grids You can also nest columns within columns.

We mean models by the way we can understand how computers interact with the world around them. They don't see models or know about models, rather models are just ways we humans can conceptualize the way a computer keeps up with memory and transfers that information to other computers. Today we're going to learn about the \" CSS Box Model \" which is, put shortly, a model that helps us understand how to change the size, shape and overall appearance on an HTML element on the screen. Think, every element we put in our HTML code has a representation on the screen. That thing on the screen is just a box or rectangle. But with CSS we can change its properties to be taller, wider, centered, have a border and even change the shape to not be a box ... The box model properties used to change the appearance of our rectangles are: height min-height max-height width min-width max-width margin - (short-hand of the following 4 properties) margin-top margin-right margin-bottom margin-left border - (short-hand of the following 3 properties) border-style border-color border-width border-radius padding - (short-hand of the following 4 properties) padding-top padding-right padding-bottom padding-left The six properties listed above comprise most of the Box Model properties. There are, of course, many more properties that allow you very fine-tuned control over the shape and size of your elements . But for much of our lessons we won't have time to cover them all (you'll have to do that on your own time!). To help you understand how the short-hand properties (seen above) can represent all of the long hand properties, below are two CSS declarations that style a Section Element the exact same way.

This CSS Box Model Visualizer is a nifty tool built by Caroline Artz to help people see how each property on the element effects the visual representation of the element on the screen. Each of the sliders are labeled with the actual properties you could type in CSS and the values you see are actual values you could code in CSS. And the changing box at the bottom right is what the element would look like. Try it! Box Model Visualizer In the upcoming lessons we'll dig a little deeper into the four categories of the CSS Box Model: Content Height & Width Margin Border Padding In addition to knowing the Box Model in your head, your browser's developer Tools offer a visualization of each element. Just open your browser's devtools, hover over an element, then click to select the element. In the DevTool Tray you should see the \"Elements\" Tab highlighted at the top-left and to the right you'll see two sub-tabs named \"Styles\" and \"Computed\". The \"Styles\" tab will list all of the CSS rules that are applied to that element including rules that are overridden (denoted by a strike-through). Under the \"Computed\" tab you'll see a box with colors of blue(content), green(padding), yellow(border), orange(margin) along with numbers indicating the value in pixels.

A product is more than the product. It is a cohesive, integrated set of experiences.

Make them all work together seamlessly.\u201d \u2014Don Norman, inventor of the term \u201cUser Experience\u201d Overview UX & UI Design First off, what are they? UI Design stands for User-Interface Design which means the layout of a web page on the screen for which our users will interact with our web app. UX stands for User-Experience Design which incorporates UI along with the flow of the app, the marketing of the app, the data collection and storage, the story that's told to the user from first advertisement through sign-on and day-to-day use. To be frank, it's a very wide and all encompassing craft; which begs the question: why are we talking about it here? Most apps are built with distinct intention so that users adopt them into their daily life, use them with frequency, talk about them to their friends, and generate revenue for the company that built them. Behind these intentions are UX Designers who think about the way users might use the apps, how to improve them, and plan for future features. The decisions of these Designers will filter down through your team lead and onto your desktop to figure out how to implement into code. By learning about UI and UX Design now, you can practice on your own websites and prepare yourself for understanding why certain decisions are made. Don't worry, you don't have to be great at design to understand and do your job as a Front-End Dev. One of the tools used to communicate between designers, product managers, product owners, clients, front-end developers, and graphic designers are Wireframes . To really understand these two trades PLEASE see the video \"Bad Doors = Bad Design\" in the Additional Resources below! Wireframes Just as a blueprint is drafted for the construction of a house or building, wireframes are created to communicate the structure and functionality of a website or app. When a design, or mockup is given to you from your design team it will be your job to translate that mockup into code that is read by browsers of all sorts and shipped across the world. Big stuff, right? Yeah, so we'll use a wireframe to help us, the Front-End Developer, to make a plan for our code before we get into the difficult tasks of seeing the big picture while typing out one. Line. At. A. Time. It's important to understand that for designers, wireframing usually comes before a mockup because they're working out the rough ideas first. But, you can also use wireframing to draw on top of the mockups you get to create a plan for your code. This is what we'll be doing everyday in class from now on so you're really good at it. Constructing a Wireframe Before beginning to wireframe, a designer would decide on the objective of their webpage. What idea are they trying to communicate? What do they want their user to do with it? \"Website wireframes are 90% thinking/planning and just 10% drawing\" - Design and Function The wireframe is a visual guide that gives us a framework, or plan, on which to build our website. We use it to lay our site's elements to best support our specific purpose or goal . Examples of Page Goals include: encourage a button to be clicked, earn your users' confidence, prove your social credibility, persuade your users to download an eBook, motivate your users to complete a payment, reaching potential customers in order to sell a product, and much, much more.... No doubt! Wireframing can save you hours of time. As you saw in the video above, if you are worried about perfect alignment, or other details, when you're working on your basic layout, you're wasting time, and causing yourself needless stress. Break apart your tasks, and do them in the correct order. Planning visually on paper or in a wireframing tool before you think about the coding will save you time in the long run, because you will have a clear idea of what you're working toward, and won't waste work that will have to be redone. Do yourself a favor, and wireframe every project you work on \u2014 every one . Your code may be efficient and elegant, and provide awesome functionality, but none of that will matter if users aren't sure where to click. That is why it's important to spend time focusing on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). A UX designer's job is to positively influence perception of products and companies, so as to encourage people to use them more. A couple of examples of excellent UX designs are Spotify.com and Apple.com . Examples of the opposite extreme might be arngren.net and RockAuto.com . Dig deeper into what makes for good (and bad) UX design here . Again, checkout the videos in the Additional Resources to get some tips and tool for creating wireframes. Practice It - Build a Wireframe Using a paper and pencil, sketch out the boxes you see in the picture above; think about the way you might code it in HTML; ask yourself which of the elements that you've learned so far would work best to create these boxes (i.e. <div></div> , <article></article> , etc.). What CSS rules might you need? Go get yourself some graph paper. It will make drawing in this class much easier. Push Yourself Further - Mobile Version Here's a mobile version of the same website.

For this lesson, let's back away from the code and take a slower and higher approach to understanding how our web pages are built and delivered. Request and Response Objects: The High Overview Again everything to a computer is an object . And we can visualize those objects with Object Modeling. With this in mind, let's now envision your web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc...) navigating to a URL. This act of navigation is actually a request for information or resources that are sitting at unique addresses in the internet, just like a street address for a house or building. All devices and files on the internet have a unique address we call a URL, Unique Resource Locator . So when you \"Live Serve\" your web pages you use a program to create a mini-internet on your computer and serve that web page at a URL called localhost:5500 as in, your computer is the localhost and the exact address/port it's using is 5500 . This is the exact same process when you navigate to a website on the the real internet. Large computers are holding files at specific addresses(URLs) in the internet and giving them to browsers when they request those files/resources. And this is where we'll begin to explore requests and response objects as they relate to the way our web pages are built. The Head and Body While we won't get into the deep details of these two object in this course we will need to understand the basic gist of these objects to make better sense of our files and why they're arranged the way they are. You'll need paper and pen to continue this section. Here's the gist: When a computer makes a request or a response it sends them both in the exact same shape: an object with a head and a body. Title this drawing: \"Req/Res\" Go ahead and draw a computer on the middle-left-side of your page (that's your computer) Now draw another computer on the middle-right-side of your page (that's a server/the \"Cloud\") Now draw an arrow from your computer to the server labeled \"request\" Below that arrow draw a box, then draw a line cutting that box in half horizontally. Label the top half of the box \"Head\" And the bottom half of the box is \"Body\" You can now draw an arrow from the server computer to your computer and label that \"response\" Draw another box, cut it in half, label them \"Head\" and \"Body\" The drawing you should have is the premise of how the internet works and the basis for everything we will learn in the next few months. All data exchanges are just requests and response objects with two other objects inside of them called Head and Body . In the Head object there is what we call metadata . Or just simply, bits of information that tell the receiving computer something about the contents of the Body of the request or response object. And the Body object is the actual content of the request or the response . When you navigate to a page your browser sends a request object that has a property called method and its value is get as in, get whatever resources are at this address while the body is empty because there's nothing for your browser to send. When the computer in the \"Cloud\" receives your request it will put together a response object. In this response object, there will be some metadata in the Head like title , charset , and styles . This is information the browser needs to properly render the content in the Body. Take a look at the page you built a few days ago.

All devices and files on the internet have a unique address we call a URL, Unique Resource Locator .

Here we'll cover the actual <button> element because the real reason to use it over a <input type=\"button\"> element is for styling. If you're wanting to but content or images inside of a button then you'll have to use the <button></button> element. Plain and simple, that's it! However, if you want to use a <button> element on a form you have to set its type= attribute to \"submit\": type=\"submit\" and poof , you have a submission button. But learning about this new element brings us closer to a topic we've only briefly covered so far, Event Listeners. Follow Along We're about to learn how to use Event Listeners in the next lesson. To get familiar with what they are and how to use them, we'll use the familiar Button Element as a leaping off point. Go ahead and open the 101-onlineClothingStore folder you started earlier and add this bit of code to the index.html file. 1 2 3 4 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button ></ button > </ body > Turn on your Live Server and see what's on the screen. Is there a tiny grey button at the top-left of your white screen? Good, that's how it should look. Your browser comes with \" Default Visual Styles \" of content created in HTML. So all elements will come with some sort of, albeit, ugly styling. Button styling is defaulted to grey and is as wide and tall as the content inside them, the innerText . innerText is a property on ALL HTML elements. It holds the value of the text inside. When we learn how to build with <p> , <a> , and all the <h*> elements, we'll see they all have a property on them called innerText. Write that down and draw it for yourself. This is part of your Object Modeling in your own mind. Let's now add some \"innerText\" to this button. Between the opening tag and the closing tag type \"Click Me\". 1 2 3 4 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button > Click Me </ button > </ body > When we learn a little more JavaScript we'll be able to change this innerText property dynamically by writing some JS code like button.innerText = \"Oh, Click Me Again!\" For now, we'll statically set it in HTML by putting the text between the opening and closing tags. Now that we have the first property of ALL HTML elements including the button element let's play with one of its events! Again, all elements have Properties, Methods, and Events we get to use to build with. By reading the documentation of these members we learn more about them and how to use them. W3S Docs - Button Element The \"onclick\" Event + Inline JavaScript Most HTML elements have the onclick event as one of their members but Button depends on this event because what else do you do with a button besides click it? As mentioned before, Events are like triggers that fire each time the interactions happens. But until we add a function to that trigger the Event is firing a blank. Even though we don't see code that represents it, our button object currently has an undefined function attached to its onclick event. We don't typically write undefined events, but if we did write it in code it would look like this: 1 2 3 4 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"\" > Click Me </ button > </ body > Notice the empty quotes ? Inside those quotes, after the = sign is the value of this event. This is a key/value pair. the key is onclick and the value is \"\" . Let's write a value for this button's onclick key. Type this in and run it to see what happens in the browser. 1 2 3 4 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"function sayHello(){ alert('Hello!') }; sayHello();\" > Click Me </ button > </ body > The line of code we just added between the \"\" marks is actually JavaScript but it's written inline with the HTML code. This isn't a common practice anymore but it's the way developers wrote it back in the day and a good way for us to begin to learn what's going on. Take a close look at this new code and spend time trying to understand it. The best place to start is dividing it in half at the ; . NOTE: Traditionally, lines of JavaScript are ended with ; (semi-colons) although the latest versions of the language don't require it. Nevertheless, we'll use them in our first lessons as we get acquainted with the language. Before the first semi-colon we see function sayHello(){ alert('Hello!') } . With the keyword , function we are declaring a function named \"sayHello()\" and defining what it's supposed to do when called, which is: { alert('Hello')} . This segment of code is called a Declaration Block , it's where we declare to the computer the instructions we want for it to run when the function is run/executed/called/invoked. We can put any set of instructions we want between the { } but this one's pretty simple, it calls another function named alert . NOTE: These words: run, execute, call, invoke all mean the same thing: \"To perform the instructions of a particular function.\" You can interchange them as much as you like but this digital book will try to use the words \"called\" and \"invoke\". alert() is a function that opens a drop-down window that \"alerts\" you of something. It's typically used to forewarn the user they are about to submit a form or override a security measure, etc. Actually , the alert is a Method of the Window object which means we could have written the code like, { window.alert('Hello')} as well. We don't have to do this because \"alert\" isn't a method on the Button object, the Body object, or the Document object, only on the Window object so when we call it, the browser will keep going up the levels of objects until it finds the first \"alert\" method it comes to. We'll learn more about these Window Object Methods , known also as Global Methods , as we build more and more. The last two parts of this code are: 'Hello!' and sayHello(); . The first of these is easy. It's an argument . Arguments are values we, as developers, get to decide to pass into functions and the functions return different things based on what we pass into them. Try it. Change the 'Hello!' argument to something like: 'Hello, Clayton!' . Did you see the change? What about that last part? sayHello(); . This is what's called a Function Invocation . It invokes/runs the function. The way it works is by naming the function we want to invoke/call. In this case, it's sayHello then we add those trailing parenthesis afterward () to communicate to the computer we want it to run the instructions inside the Declaration Block of the function we just named. See how this is written the same as alert() ? ... sayHello() ... alert() ...? Name the function and then invoke the function/ New Word Clarification We just covered a lot of new terms so let's take a moment to revisit some of those tricksters. Function Declaration - This is where a function is declared and defined. Until it's called/invoked, it isn't doing anything except taking up memory like a recipe in your cookbook. 1 2 3 4 function myFunctionExample ( a , b ) { let sum = a + b return sum } The Declaration Block is the part between the {} where the step-by-step instruction goes. Function Invocation - This the code that calls/invokes the Function Declaration. It tells the computer to execute the instructions in the Declaration Block. 1 myFunctionExample ( 2 , 3 ) Function Arguments - These are values you can pass into functions. In the example above 2 and 3 are two arguments passed into the myFunctionExample function. Based on the instructions in the Function Declaration and the arguments passed into it, the result would be 5. Attribute/Property/Method - If you visited the Button Element Docs page your probably saw the use the word Attributes instead of Property , Event or Method . This is because HTML was created to represent visual Elements on a screen so all of the properties and their values were originally written together, in line with the elements like the line of JavaScript we just broke down. The word Attribute means the same thing as Property , Event or Method but specifically refers to something written in HTML rather than in CSS or JavaScript. Anything you see written inside the opening tag of an element is an Attribute but it refers to the Properties , Events , and Methods of that object. Example: 1 < h3 id = \"fish-fry\" > Example Title </ h3 > The H3 Element above has an id attribute. This attribute assigns the value of \"fish-fry\" the the id property of that object. NOTE: If this all doesn't gel right now, don't worry. With practice and in time it'll all come together. A Better Way to Write JavaScript The line of JavaScript we just broke down was a little hard to read because it was all on one line. Thankfully there's a better way to write it, with the <script> Element! The Document Object has a scripts property to hold scripts. When we create a Script Element we are giving the scripts property a value. And just like with our Human object, if we want them to be able to do new things we need to give them new functions like: rideBicycle() or cutWatermelon() . With the <script> element we can give our Document Object new values inside of its scripts property. Let's move our current inline JavaScript into our <script> element. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"sayHello();\" > Click Me </ button > < script > function sayHello (){ alert ( 'Hello!' ) }; </ script > </ body > Make these changes and run your page again. It should be working just as before. Now let's create another button and have it also call sayHello when its onclick event is ...clicked. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"sayHello();\" > Click Me </ button > < button onclick = \"sayHello();\" > Click Me Too </ button > < script > function sayHello (){ alert ( 'Hello!' ) }; </ script > </ body > Now build another function called sayHi but this time call the Console object's method named log() and pass into it a different string . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"sayHello();\" > Click Me </ button > < button onclick = \"sayHi();\" > Click Me Too </ button > < script > function sayHello (){ alert ( 'Hello, Window.alert Method!' ) }; function sayHi (){ console . log ( 'Hi, Console.log Method!' ) }; </ script > </ body > NOTE: In order to see this you'll have to open your DevTools and go to the Console Tab. Click on both buttons and see what happens. Summary In the next lesson we'll learn how to tie Input Elements and Button Elements together but at this point you know know how Event Listeners work, even if you've only used one: onclick= . Essentially, you figure out what action you'd like the user to do then attach it to a invocation to call a function you wanted executed when that action is done!

For this purpose, think of a user interaction with the web page as an Event and we won't our pages to be Listening for them. Remember, with programming we just need one action to trigger another action to trigger another action. So as we learn more about programming in JavaScript all you have to remember is that if you want a user to trigger a script you built, just go back and find the event listener that will capture that event. Here's a list of a few of the common event listeners: Common Mouse Events dblclick : when the mouse button is rapidly clicked on an element mousedown : when the mouse button is pressed on an element mouseup : when the mouse button is released on an element onclick : when the mouse button is pressed & released on an element Common Keyboard Events keydown : when a key is pressed, keyup : when a key is released Common Form Events As if you didn't have enough to remember about Forms, there are event specific to them! onfocus : when a user bring into focus a form element either by clicking on it or tabbing to it. onblur : this is the opposite, as soon as they move away from the element. onchange : when a value of an input is changed onsubmit : when a form is submitted.

You can do all of this through web development but you can't do it without developing yourself while you do. In the firsts few week we learned how to practice mindfulness and how it trains you to focus your thoughts, energy, and emotions toward what you want when you want it then we learned about self-motivation and what it means to tie yourself to what you're doing and do it for you and not for others. This week we'll look a how all the \"regular\" and \"normal\" habits we do are actually tearing away at our creative abilities and our chance at conscious happiness and purpose but how we can accept change in our life to improve our heath in all of our realms: physical, mental, and spiritual. Let's get to work.

It is the Mother of All Elements , it creates elements, removes elements, and changes their contents. The Document is THE OBJECT. It's why there is a Document Object Model , because all objects are born, live, and die with the Document Object. To begin learning the powers of this omnipotent goddess let's create yet another button we can call a function with. Go ahead and do this by yourself in that 101-onlineClothingStore folder we've been in and out of. You got this, just create a new button with \"Create New Object\" as its innerText. Then give the onclick= attribute the value of createNewObject() . In JavaScript create a new function called createNewObject and write a console.log(\"TESTING\") to make sure it's working before we move on. The createElement() Method Now that you got that in order let's build out that function's declaration block. Let's first create a variable to hold a reference to an object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> <!-- more code up here... --> < script > // and more JS code here... function createNewObject () { let newObject = document . createElement ( \"H3\" ) } </ script > The variable is called newObject and its value is a new H3 object/element the Document created with its createElement() method. That's right! We're now using properties, events, and methods!!! Now let's create another variable that will hold a reference to a Text Object/Node. We'll give it some basic text for now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> <!-- more code up here... --> < script > // and more JS code here... function createNewObject () { let newObject = document . createElement ( \"H3\" ) let text = document . createTextNode ( \"THIS IS A TEST.\" ) } </ script > Now we need to append that Text Node/Object to our newObject . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> <!-- more code up here... --> < script > // and more JS code here... function createNewObject () { let newObject = document . createElement ( \"H3\" ) let text = document . createTextNode ( \"THIS IS A TEST.\" ) newObject . appendChild ( text ) } </ script > Notice that the newObject has this .appendChild() method on it as if by magic! It's not magic it inheritance . Even though it's a brand-spankin\u2019 new H3 object, it's inheriting all of the Global Methods that are available to all HTML elements. The last step is to append our newObject to our Body object. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> <!-- more code up here... --> < script > // and more JS code here... function createNewObject () { let newObject = document . createElement ( \"h3\" ) let text = document . createTextNode ( \"THIS IS A TEST.\" ) newObject . appendChild ( text ) document . body . appendChild ( newObject ) } </ script > </ body > Quick Review Wow!! That was a lot, let's slow this train down and look at it more closely. Inside our functions declaration block, we declared 4 steps for the computer to do. Create a new variable and use the Document's createElement method to place a new H3 element at its value Then create another variable and use the Document's createTextNode method to place a Text Node/Object with \"THIS IS A TEST\" as dummy data. Use the Global method, appendChild() to stick the Text Node/Object into the new H3 Object. Use the same method to stick the new H3 Object into the Body of the Document object. That wasn't so bad, was it? Use the Data in the Variable Instead of using that dummy data, \"THIS IS A TEST\" let's instead use the data our user would put in. Replace that argument with usersInput . Now that line of code will read: let text = document.createTextNode(usersInput) . Test it out. How's it working? Annoying that you have to manually delete your input? This is why we use Input Elements and Button Elements inside Form Elements. But we'll have to get to that in a later lesson. For now, you have a challenge!

When you don't know how to do something, start. Beware of the paralysis of analysis. Be a person of action. \u2014Mamie McCullough Let's zoom in a little from those higher-level view and talk about a specific element we haven't worked with yet, the Form Element. As you might have guessed it's used to create forms! Or as defined by MDN : \"The HTML <form> element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.\" The Form element is an object in HTML that presents to the human-user a place to input information/data but also gives us a place to store that data until they complete the form and click the submit button which triggers a fetch request to send that data to a server then to a database. To use Form elements properly we have to learn their attributes(properties and methods). Attributes of the Form Like all other HTML Elements, the Form Element has all the Global Attributes (events and methods) along with a few special ones of its own. Let's break them into two categories: Required and Optional Required Attributes/Properties: action, enctype, method, novalidate, target These properties are required to be defined for your forms to work properly so let's look at them and how they're used. We'll be using the following code as a reference point. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <!-- index.html --> < form action = \"https://www.singlesingerssite.com/signin.htm\" method = \"post\" autocomplete = \"off\" > < div > < label for = \"email\" > Email </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"email\" id = \"email\" required > </ div > < div > < label for = \"password\" > Password </ label > < input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" id = \"password\" required > </ div > < div > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Subscribe!\" > </ div > </ form > <!-- Notes on the unfamiliar part of the code above: --> <!-- The Div element is used to divide out the page --> <!-- Label Elements are used to label an Input Element --> <!-- Input Elements are versatile and can be used for any type of form input --> action= - The value of this must be a URL like the one you see above. This tells the form where to send the data when it's submitted by the human-user. However, the preference for this technique has been replaced with creating a function that uses fetch to handle the HTTP request and calling it onclick= of a submit button, i.e. <input type=\"submit\" onclick=\"handleSubmit()\">, method= - If you choose to use the action= attribute to define the URL that will process your forms data, then you have to define the method as a POST. Later in this lesson, you'll learn about the multiple values you can use here to send different types of Requests over HTTP(S). For now, the two values you can use here are \"post\" and \"get\" . If you use the preferred fetch alternative then you will need to declare the Request as a POST in the fetch because the default value of the Form Element's method= is get , see below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 // inside a <script> element or in .js file fetch ( 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products' , { method : \"POST\" , body : {} }) Properties that are Required but have Implied Default Values enctype= - This defines the type of encoding the data should go through before it's sent over HTTP. The values you can use are: \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" : The default value and used for most forms. You don't see it defined and declared in the code above because it's the default value if you don't type out one of the following instead. \"multipart/form-data\" : If your form accepts files as a possible input then you need to declare it using this value. \"text/plain\" - Introduced by HTML5 for debugging purposes. target= - this property specifies where the Response object should load; that is, after the form is submitted and there's a response from the other page, site, or server where should the response go? The option you have are: _self : Load the response into the same browsing context(window/tab) as the current one. This is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank : Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context \u2014 usually a new tab or window, depending on the user\u2019s browser settings. _parent : Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self . _top : Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self . NOTE: later on we'll override this behavior with a .preventDefault() but more on that later. novalidate - The default attribute is validate which translate to validate=true . The reason this is defaulted to validate is because form validation is the first step in preventing hackers\u2019 attacks. It's not the end-all-be-all but it is the first layer of security in building apps. Form Validation is part of a larger practice called Client-side Validation and HTML comes with built-in measures that we'll get into when we learn about the Input Element. For now, in the code example notice required and type=email and type=password . These are form validation measures built into HTML because they require the human-user to fill them out and the Email Type Inputs require a @ and .com while the Password Type Inputs mask the password with \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . Try it. Throw the code into a new HTML file and serve it up. Do you see the \u2022s ? Try submitting an email with the @ . Most of the time you do want to validate so you won't type novalidate and don't need to specify validate because its default value is implied. Optional Form Attributes/Properties autocomplete= - allows the human-user's browser to auto-fill the form if they have their information stored in their browser. You can toggle this with the values: \"on\" and \"off\" however many browsers are opting to not read \"off\" for login fields. NOTE: If you are building a page that allows the human-user to update their password you can use the third value: autocomplete=\"new-password\" to prevent the browser from auto-filling the inputs on that form. accept-charset= - sets the language/ Character Set the form can take like German, Cyrillic, Japanese, so forth. For most languages, including English this is \"utf-8\" as in: <form accept-charset=\"utf-8\"> . However, you don't have to set this property/attribute because it defaults to the character set/ Content Encoding you have in the Head Element to set the character set of your page: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> rel= - this gives you a place to give an annotation or explanation of the form is something is unclear. Most of the time you won't use this property. Inputs The Form element has many elements that go inside of it but, by far, the most common elements are the Label and Input Element: 1 2 < label for = \"password\" > Password </ label > < input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" id = \"password\" required > This is because the Input element is a versatile element that can be used for all sorts of inputs from text and numbers to files and colors. NOTE: The HTML snippet above has a Label element with a for attribute set to \"password\" . In this way it is now tied to the Input element id=\"password\" and NOT the name or type attributes. You see that? The label is for the id of the input. The list below tells you most of the values you can give to the type attribute of an Input element. <input type=\"text\"> : defines a one-line text input field. If you need a bigger area for lots of text you'll use a TextArea element. <input type=\"password\"> : defines a password field. <input type=\"submit\"> : defines a button for submitting form data. <input type=\"radio\"> : defines a radio button. <input type=\"checkbox\" >: defines a checkbox. <input type=\"button\"> : defines a button. <input type=\"date\"> : creates a date selector <input type=\"color\"> : provides a color picker wheel <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> : creates a button that is registered automatically with its parent form element as a \"submit\" button AND it doesn't need a partner Label element. <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\"> - creates a button that defaults to call the Form's .reset() method to clear all of it's fields. Other Attributes of the Input Element Form validation means we're verifying the data a user puts in, such as the type, length, validity, and shape we want so we can properly save it to a database. NOTE: Later in this full-stack program you'll see that data must be in the same format, or shape, as the other bits of data being saved with it else the computer can't read it. It is costly both in time and money to send the data from the user to our databases only for it to be in the wrong format. A shorter, safer, and cheaper first filter we can use is HTML's built-in form validation, and you've actually already seen one of the tools, type , which specifies the type of data that can go into an input. We'll not cover them all in extreme detail because you'll have docs to reference later. But because you need a good introduction of form validation and some tools to do it, let's look at a few of the other attributes we can leverage on Input elements. maxlength= : limits the maximum number of characters that can go into the input minlength= : limits the minimum number of characters that can go into the input max= and min= : creates upper and lower limits on a data input required : forces the user to fill out the input type=\"email\" : verifies that the input has a @ and .com type=\"phone\" : verifies that it is a legit phone number autocomplete=\"on\" : let's the browser offer autocompletion of the form type=\"password\" : blots out the characters in this field automatically placeholder= : isn't a validation attribute but it does give the user a hint about what goes in the field 1 2 < label for = \"price\" > Price ($) </ label > < input type = \"number\" name = \"price\" id = \"price\" placeholder = \"$10.00\" onkeyup = \"updateNewProduct(this)\" min = \"1\" max = \"100000\" required > MDN Docs - Input Element Other Elements That Belong to the Form Element Besides Input, there are a few other form elements you should know about but don't concern yourself with them too much . Remember, there are a lot of tools built into HTML that were developed over years of trial and error and there is no way for us to learn every detail to perfection right now. Take this as a very superficial survey of these other elements: <fieldset> & <legend> : The fieldset groups related data together and the legend acts the same way as the Label does for the Input. In this way, <fieldset> and <legend> always go together. <textarea> : As mentioned before, it is for large sections of text like this page you're reading now!!! ;) <datalist> : gives you a \"pre-fill\" menu for your inputs <output> : of course, shows you the output of some script you've built.

Do it now! When you don't know how to do something, start. Beware of the paralysis of analysis. Be a person of action. \u2014Mamie McCullough Let's zoom in a little from those higher-level view and talk about a specific element we haven't worked with yet, the Form Element. As you might have guessed it's used to create forms! Or as defined by MDN : \"The HTML <form> element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.\" The Form element is an object in HTML that presents to the human-user a place to input information/data but also gives us a place to store that data until they complete the form and click the submit button which triggers a fetch request to send that data to a server then to a database. To use Form elements properly we have to learn their attributes(properties and methods).","title":"The Form Element"},{"location":"module-2/formElement/#attributes-of-the-form","text":"Like all other HTML Elements, the Form Element has all the Global Attributes (events and methods) along with a few special ones of its own.

We'll be using the following code as a reference point. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <!-- index.html --> < form action = \"https://www.singlesingerssite.com/signin.htm\" method = \"post\" autocomplete = \"off\" > < div > < label for = \"email\" > Email </ label > < input type = \"text\" name = \"email\" id = \"email\" required > </ div > < div > < label for = \"password\" > Password </ label > < input type = \"password\" name = \"password\" id = \"password\" required > </ div > < div > < input type = \"submit\" value = \"Subscribe!\" > </ div > </ form > <!-- Notes on the unfamiliar part of the code above: --> <!-- The Div element is used to divide out the page --> <!-- Label Elements are used to label an Input Element --> <!-- Input Elements are versatile and can be used for any type of form input --> action= - The value of this must be a URL like the one you see above. This tells the form where to send the data when it's submitted by the human-user. However, the preference for this technique has been replaced with creating a function that uses fetch to handle the HTTP request and calling it onclick= of a submit button, i.e. <input type=\"submit\" onclick=\"handleSubmit()\">, method= - If you choose to use the action= attribute to define the URL that will process your forms data, then you have to define the method as a POST. Later in this lesson, you'll learn about the multiple values you can use here to send different types of Requests over HTTP(S). For now, the two values you can use here are \"post\" and \"get\" . If you use the preferred fetch alternative then you will need to declare the Request as a POST in the fetch because the default value of the Form Element's method= is get , see below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 // inside a <script> element or in .js file fetch ( 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products' , { method : \"POST\" , body : {} })","title":"Required Attributes/Properties: action, enctype, method, novalidate, target"},{"location":"module-2/formElement/#properties-that-are-required-but-have-implied-default-values","text":"enctype= - This defines the type of encoding the data should go through before it's sent over HTTP. The values you can use are: \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" : The default value and used for most forms. You don't see it defined and declared in the code above because it's the default value if you don't type out one of the following instead. \"multipart/form-data\" : If your form accepts files as a possible input then you need to declare it using this value. \"text/plain\" - Introduced by HTML5 for debugging purposes. target= - this property specifies where the Response object should load; that is, after the form is submitted and there's a response from the other page, site, or server where should the response go? The option you have are: _self : Load the response into the same browsing context(window/tab) as the current one. This is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank : Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context \u2014 usually a new tab or window, depending on the user\u2019s browser settings. _parent : Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self . _top : Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self . NOTE: later on we'll override this behavior with a .preventDefault() but more on that later. novalidate - The default attribute is validate which translate to validate=true . The reason this is defaulted to validate is because form validation is the first step in preventing hackers\u2019 attacks. It's not the end-all-be-all but it is the first layer of security in building apps. Form Validation is part of a larger practice called Client-side Validation and HTML comes with built-in measures that we'll get into when we learn about the Input Element. For now, in the code example notice required and type=email and type=password . These are form validation measures built into HTML because they require the human-user to fill them out and the Email Type Inputs require a @ and .com while the Password Type Inputs mask the password with \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . Try it. Throw the code into a new HTML file and serve it up. Do you see the \u2022s ? Try submitting an email with the @ . Most of the time you do want to validate so you won't type novalidate and don't need to specify validate because its default value is implied.","title":"Properties that are Required but have Implied Default Values"},{"location":"module-2/formElement/#optional-form-attributesproperties","text":"autocomplete= - allows the human-user's browser to auto-fill the form if they have their information stored in their browser. You can toggle this with the values: \"on\" and \"off\" however many browsers are opting to not read \"off\" for login fields. NOTE: If you are building a page that allows the human-user to update their password you can use the third value: autocomplete=\"new-password\" to prevent the browser from auto-filling the inputs on that form. accept-charset= - sets the language/ Character Set the form can take like German, Cyrillic, Japanese, so forth. For most languages, including English this is \"utf-8\" as in: <form accept-charset=\"utf-8\"> . However, you don't have to set this property/attribute because it defaults to the character set/ Content Encoding you have in the Head Element to set the character set of your page: <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> rel= - this gives you a place to give an annotation or explanation of the form is something is unclear.

NOTE: The HTML snippet above has a Label element with a for attribute set to \"password\" . In this way it is now tied to the Input element id=\"password\" and NOT the name or type attributes. You see that? The label is for the id of the input. The list below tells you most of the values you can give to the type attribute of an Input element. <input type=\"text\"> : defines a one-line text input field. If you need a bigger area for lots of text you'll use a TextArea element. <input type=\"password\"> : defines a password field. <input type=\"submit\"> : defines a button for submitting form data. <input type=\"radio\"> : defines a radio button. <input type=\"checkbox\" >: defines a checkbox. <input type=\"button\"> : defines a button. <input type=\"date\"> : creates a date selector <input type=\"color\"> : provides a color picker wheel <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"> : creates a button that is registered automatically with its parent form element as a \"submit\" button AND it doesn't need a partner Label element. <input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\"> - creates a button that defaults to call the Form's .reset() method to clear all of it's fields.","title":"Inputs"},{"location":"module-2/formElement/#other-attributes-of-the-input-element","text":"Form validation means we're verifying the data a user puts in, such as the type, length, validity, and shape we want so we can properly save it to a database.

It is costly both in time and money to send the data from the user to our databases only for it to be in the wrong format. A shorter, safer, and cheaper first filter we can use is HTML's built-in form validation, and you've actually already seen one of the tools, type , which specifies the type of data that can go into an input. We'll not cover them all in extreme detail because you'll have docs to reference later. But because you need a good introduction of form validation and some tools to do it, let's look at a few of the other attributes we can leverage on Input elements. maxlength= : limits the maximum number of characters that can go into the input minlength= : limits the minimum number of characters that can go into the input max= and min= : creates upper and lower limits on a data input required : forces the user to fill out the input type=\"email\" : verifies that the input has a @ and .com type=\"phone\" : verifies that it is a legit phone number autocomplete=\"on\" : let's the browser offer autocompletion of the form type=\"password\" : blots out the characters in this field automatically placeholder= : isn't a validation attribute but it does give the user a hint about what goes in the field 1 2 < label for = \"price\" > Price ($) </ label > < input type = \"number\" name = \"price\" id = \"price\" placeholder = \"$10.00\" onkeyup = \"updateNewProduct(this)\" min = \"1\" max = \"100000\" required > MDN Docs - Input Element","title":"Other Attributes of the Input Element"},{"location":"module-2/formElement/#other-elements-that-belong-to-the-form-element","text":"Besides Input, there are a few other form elements you should know about but don't concern yourself with them too much .

Take this as a very superficial survey of these other elements: <fieldset> & <legend> : The fieldset groups related data together and the legend acts the same way as the Label does for the Input. In this way, <fieldset> and <legend> always go together. <textarea> : As mentioned before, it is for large sections of text like this page you're reading now!!! ;) <datalist> : gives you a \"pre-fill\" menu for your inputs <output> : of course, shows you the output of some script you've built.

No, not apps yet but trust that the technology used for apps is the same technology used to build website and anything you'll ever want to build in the future, is also built on the foundations we'll learn in this course.

The internet is a continuous connection of various computer and devices that includes your phone, computer, watch, and doorbell. They are all connected through various means including coax, CAT5, fiber, WiFi, bluetooth, 3G, 4G, LTE, & 5G. Through all of these connections and the millions of devices they connect to the internet is created. But this still doesn't answer our question: \"How does it work??\" How Does it Work? In order for these devices to talk to one another they must rely on a series of steps that detail how, when, and what data transfers look like. There's a word, we don't often hear, called protocol that refers to a series of agreed upon steps taken when something happens as in: \"Firemen have a protocol for leaving the firehouse and responding to a fire.\" The internet and its devices depend on an agreed about series of steps and organization of data to ensure that your computer knows how to interpret the information sent to it from Target or Netflix. This protocol is called HTTP or HTTPS, yes the prefix in your browser's address bar.(Go look.) HTTP/HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (secure) . This protocol, or series of agreed upon steps and how data transfers look, is what computers/machines use when they need to move data between one another. While this course will not dig into all the technical details of HTTP(S) we will learn much more about this protocol in 311 when we learn how to plan, design, and build databases and servers(computers without screens/The Cloud). For now, it's enough to know that what we will be learning in this 101 course, HTML, JS, & CSS, are languages that create data that fits within the HTTProtocol and represent to a web browser(Safari, Chrome, etc...) what content we want on our pages, what our pages will look like and how they interact with people(users).","title":"How the Internet Works"},{"location":"module-2/howTheInternetWorks/#the-internetweb-our-job-as-developers-and-ways-to-think-about-it","text":"As we learn this new language called JavaScript it's important we start to create a new perspective in our minds about how computers interact with the world and how code is used to communication intentions to a computer because our website and apps will only grow in size from here on.

We'll be referencing the code below because it is the minimum amount of code needed to build a web page. All other HTML elements/objects and their properties, methods, & events will stem from this basic code. You can quickly generate this boilerplate code by going to VS Code, then creating an index.html file and typing on the first line: html:5 + Enter . Go ahead and try it. Create folder called 101-onlineClothingStore and create an index.html file you can use to follow along with in this lesson and revisit in a few upcoming lessons. I'll wait. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 <!-- index.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" > < title > Document </ title > </ head > < body > </ body > </ html > index.html In most of the projects you've built, you've been working in a file called index.html . The name of this file is incredibly important because it is the default file that is served FIRST. index.html is the root file for ALL websites. When you navigate to Facebook.com or Target.com you will receive their index.html file. If you click on links to go to other page you'll be given other pages like: about.html or termsofagreement.html . You are allowed to name your .html files whatever you want but the very first file you want served must be named: index.html and in the root directory/folder, meaning it can not be hidden in another folder, it must be at the top-level of the entire project's folder. Furthermore, the .html extension denotes a file written in HTML code while .css denotes CSS code and .js denotes JavaScript code. There's no requirement for you to use the name index for CSS or JS files but it may be helpful to you as a developer to name your files similarly so they can be grouped together in your mind and organized in folders. For instance, index-styles.css and index-scripts.js might be styles and scripts used only on the index.html file while about-styles.css and about-scripts.js might be used only on the about.html file. You'll figure it out as you go! DOCTYPE Tag At the very top of all HTML files we see this strange looking, self-closing tag : <!DOCTYPE html> . This is a hold-over from older versions of the HTML language. It was originally used to declare the type of this document is (\"HTML\" and not \"XML\"), as well as, the version of HTML it's written in but now everyone uses HTML5+ so we only have to write html to declare that the document the computer is going to read is in HTML5. It also communicates to the browser to build a Document object. Remember, code is used for communication . In this case, this bit of code is communicating to the browser, \"Hey, inside your Window object go ahead and create a Document object so we can build some more objects inside of it.\" To us, humans, we can read this code and visually imagine a Document object being built with other objects to be added as we go along. See a version of this object modeling below!! W3S Docs - doctype Element html Element The next bit of code we see in <html></html> . This code represents the html object. It is what's know as the root element/object . It's the actual Document Object that's being rendered on your screen. We call it the root element because all other elements/objects are children or descendants of it including Head and Body and all the elements we'll build inside them. This is the beginning(the root ) of our Document Object Model , the first object that all other objects get put inside of; hence the moniker: \"Mother of All Objects\". The second takeaway here is to make sure you define the human speaking language you're page is written in. For instances, <html lang=\"en\"> stands for English while <html lang=\"fr\"> would stand for French. You can find all the Global Languages codes here . W3S Docs - html Element Head Element As discussed earlier, the <head> element contains machine-readable information ( metadata ) about the documents content, like its title(the bit you see in the tab of your browser), scripts(JS) see note , and style sheets(CSS). The elements/objects that go inside <head> are: <base> - create base URLs for all links on a page (we'll learn about this later) <link> - used to tell the browser where to find CSS files that define styles/the way our page is supposed to look <meta> - multi-purpose including viewport sizing, Search Engine keywords, web services, and data about data (metadata); it contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts, and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. <style> - an older and abandoned way of including styling to a page; use <link> element instead <title> - the words that are displayed in the tab at the top of your browser Aside from the content between the opening and closing tags of the <title></title> element/object, none of the code in the <head> element/object is displayed to the user. It is only read by the browser to know how to display the <body> and its content. NOTE: Before going any further we need to clear up some terminology so we're all on the same page and can stop reading multiple words that refer to the same thing. So far we know that computers use objects to store information. So to a computer, everything is an object. But in the HTML language, we often say the word \"element\". As in the <body></body> element has an opening-tag : <body> and a closing-tag : </body> . Together they create an HTML Element called the Body. This is just a language-specific way to describe an object. In HTML we say element instead of object . But as we dig into JavaScript and other languages we only say the word Object . Both are one and the same as far as the computer knows, they're just building blocks with their own properties, methods, and events. \"Element\" is the HTML way of saying \"Object\" but because Elements are Objects that have visual representations on the screen we call them, Elements. From now on, if we're talking in HTML we'll use the word \" Element \" but just know in your mind it's the same thing as an Object . Just a thing with properties, methods, and events. W3S Docs - Head Element ** NOTE: Usually scripts(.js files) are linked to HTML files at the bottom of the Body with a <script href=\"\"> element but with the new defer keyword it is acceptable to link your scripts in the Head element now. Body Element Finally, we come to the exciting element: The Body Element! Inside the Body Element is where ALL of the contents of a page live. Whatever page you navigate to on the web, you are viewing the contents of the page. Try it. Go to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element and open the Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools). Right-click > inspect > then click on the Console tab. Where the cursor's flashing, type or copy/paste this line of code: document.head.parentNode.removeChild(document.head); and press ENTER. You should see a significant change in the appearance of the page. This is because you just removed the Head Element from the document and the Head Element contains links to stylesheets. The code you just wrote is a line of JavaScript that says, \"Hey Console, go the document object and access its Head object, then find the property parentNode on the Head object. From there, invoke the removeChild method so the Head removes itself.\" It's a little lengthy but it gets the job done. Now that we can see the content clearly without all that CSS in the way. Let's talk about it. Click on the tiny button in the top-left with the arrow or type CMD + SHIFT + C (mac)/Ctrl + SHIFT + C(Windows). Now move your mouse along the page to see all the elements of the page highlight as you hover over them. NOTE: If the elements are not highlighting repeat the previous instructions. You may have turned them off when they were already on. Move your cursor around until you can find the Header Element. How many Article Elements can you find? Can you find the HTML element? All of these elements are various building blocks (Objects) that were arranged in a certain way to build this page. Check it out: Back in the Console type: document.querySelectorAll(\"h1\").length + ENTER. What number was returned? You should have gotten 1 because there is only 1 <h1> element and there should only ever be 1 <h1> on any page! Try it again. Type: document.querySelectorAll(\"a\").length How many Anchor elements are there? What about document.querySelectorAll(\"article\").length ? Go ahead and change the argument between the () to any of the elements you see on the page or currently know about to see how many there are on the entire page. Do you know what this script is doing? Can you read it? It goes like this: \"Hey Console, ask the Document object to invoke its \"querySelectorAll\" method with \"a\" as its argument to find all Anchor elements, then give us the value of the length property on the object that method returns.\" The querySelectorAll method selects/finds all elements that match the argument you pass into. Give it \"h1\" and it'll return 1, give it \"section\" and it'll return 1, \"a\" will return 481. Go ahead and try any or all of the 115 different HTML elements to see what you find! W3S Docs - Body Element W3S Docs - .querySelectorAll() Method Indentation Code is used to communicate programming intentions to a computer but the computer doesn't have eyes it just has 0s and 1s so space/whitespace doesn't matter to it. In fact, when your HTML, CSS, and JS code files are prepared for a production environment (open for the world to see) they are minified which means all of the whitespace is removed including space between words, space between lines of code, and indentations. Your files will be minified/compress so they are faster for the computer to run and lighter for the internet to transfer. So why indentation? Because code is also used to communicate to humans, we use indentation to organize objects; or rather representation of objects in our code. When you auto-generated your boilerplate HTML earlier there likely wasn't any indentation before the head and body elements/objects but in this code example there is. This extra whitespace is to help you start seeing these different objects using different vertical layers, indentation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <!-- index.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" > < title > Document </ title > </ head > < body > < header ></ header > < main > < h1 > Hello World </ h1 > < section ></ section > < section ></ section > </ main > < footer ></ footer > </ body > </ html > The html element is the the top-level/root element so it is slammed up against the far-left side of file. But head and body are direct descendants of html and siblings to one-another; therefore they are indented one tab (2-4 spaces). Objects directly inside the head and body are thusly tabbed in again: meta , meta , and title . These element can be described as Siblings Elements . In the body we see some new elements. Can you guess which elements are direct descendants of the body element and siblings to one another? In Summary: The Building Blocks of a Web Developer All web pages and sites are built with the same HTML Elements(objects). These are our building blocks as web developers. Learning about them and their properties, methods, and events is what we will be doing in this course. In the next lesson we'll break the surface of how to capture interactions between humans and computers and how to give instructions to the computer when those Events/interactions occur. W3S Docs - HTML Events NOTE: When you see these links ^ saying something about \"Docs\" or \"Know Your Docs\" you should bookmark them in a bookmarks folder called HTML Docs or CSS Docs or JS Docs for the language they relate to. Documentation is one of the top three tools of developers. Every developer depends on them because there's so much \"invisible\" stuff to learn we mere-humans can't remember it all. What we can do is spend our energy creatively building with these technologies and relying on documentation(docs) to help us find the path when we're lost and exploring.

Create folder called 101-onlineClothingStore and create an index.html file you can use to follow along with in this lesson and revisit in a few upcoming lessons.

The name of this file is incredibly important because it is the default file that is served FIRST. index.html is the root file for ALL websites. When you navigate to Facebook.com or Target.com you will receive their index.html file. If you click on links to go to other page you'll be given other pages like: about.html or termsofagreement.html . You are allowed to name your .html files whatever you want but the very first file you want served must be named: index.html and in the root directory/folder, meaning it can not be hidden in another folder, it must be at the top-level of the entire project's folder. Furthermore, the .html extension denotes a file written in HTML code while .css denotes CSS code and .js denotes JavaScript code. There's no requirement for you to use the name index for CSS or JS files but it may be helpful to you as a developer to name your files similarly so they can be grouped together in your mind and organized in folders. For instance, index-styles.css and index-scripts.js might be styles and scripts used only on the index.html file while about-styles.css and about-scripts.js might be used only on the about.html file. You'll figure it out as you go!","title":"index.html"},{"location":"module-2/htmlElements/#doctype-tag","text":"At the very top of all HTML files we see this strange looking, self-closing tag : <!DOCTYPE html> . This is a hold-over from older versions of the HTML language. It was originally used to declare the type of this document is (\"HTML\" and not \"XML\"), as well as, the version of HTML it's written in but now everyone uses HTML5+ so we only have to write html to declare that the document the computer is going to read is in HTML5. It also communicates to the browser to build a Document object. Remember, code is used for communication . In this case, this bit of code is communicating to the browser, \"Hey, inside your Window object go ahead and create a Document object so we can build some more objects inside of it.\" To us, humans, we can read this code and visually imagine a Document object being built with other objects to be added as we go along. See a version of this object modeling below!! W3S Docs - doctype Element","title":"DOCTYPE Tag"},{"location":"module-2/htmlElements/#html-element","text":"The next bit of code we see in <html></html> . This code represents the html object. It is what's know as the root element/object . It's the actual Document Object that's being rendered on your screen. We call it the root element because all other elements/objects are children or descendants of it including Head and Body and all the elements we'll build inside them. This is the beginning(the root ) of our Document Object Model , the first object that all other objects get put inside of; hence the moniker: \"Mother of All Objects\". The second takeaway here is to make sure you define the human speaking language you're page is written in. For instances, <html lang=\"en\"> stands for English while <html lang=\"fr\"> would stand for French. You can find all the Global Languages codes here . W3S Docs - html Element","title":"html Element"},{"location":"module-2/htmlElements/#head-element","text":"As discussed earlier, the <head> element contains machine-readable information ( metadata ) about the documents content, like its title(the bit you see in the tab of your browser), scripts(JS) see note , and style sheets(CSS). The elements/objects that go inside <head> are: <base> - create base URLs for all links on a page (we'll learn about this later) <link> - used to tell the browser where to find CSS files that define styles/the way our page is supposed to look <meta> - multi-purpose including viewport sizing, Search Engine keywords, web services, and data about data (metadata); it contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts, and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. <style> - an older and abandoned way of including styling to a page; use <link> element instead <title> - the words that are displayed in the tab at the top of your browser Aside from the content between the opening and closing tags of the <title></title> element/object, none of the code in the <head> element/object is displayed to the user. It is only read by the browser to know how to display the <body> and its content. NOTE: Before going any further we need to clear up some terminology so we're all on the same page and can stop reading multiple words that refer to the same thing. So far we know that computers use objects to store information. So to a computer, everything is an object. But in the HTML language, we often say the word \"element\". As in the <body></body> element has an opening-tag : <body> and a closing-tag : </body> . Together they create an HTML Element called the Body. This is just a language-specific way to describe an object. In HTML we say element instead of object . But as we dig into JavaScript and other languages we only say the word Object . Both are one and the same as far as the computer knows, they're just building blocks with their own properties, methods, and events. \"Element\" is the HTML way of saying \"Object\" but because Elements are Objects that have visual representations on the screen we call them, Elements. From now on, if we're talking in HTML we'll use the word \" Element \" but just know in your mind it's the same thing as an Object . Just a thing with properties, methods, and events. W3S Docs - Head Element ** NOTE: Usually scripts(.js files) are linked to HTML files at the bottom of the Body with a <script href=\"\"> element but with the new defer keyword it is acceptable to link your scripts in the Head element now.","title":"Head Element"},{"location":"module-2/htmlElements/#body-element","text":"Finally, we come to the exciting element: The Body Element! Inside the Body Element is where ALL of the contents of a page live. Whatever page you navigate to on the web, you are viewing the contents of the page. Try it. Go to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element and open the Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools). Right-click > inspect > then click on the Console tab. Where the cursor's flashing, type or copy/paste this line of code: document.head.parentNode.removeChild(document.head); and press ENTER. You should see a significant change in the appearance of the page. This is because you just removed the Head Element from the document and the Head Element contains links to stylesheets. The code you just wrote is a line of JavaScript that says, \"Hey Console, go the document object and access its Head object, then find the property parentNode on the Head object. From there, invoke the removeChild method so the Head removes itself.\" It's a little lengthy but it gets the job done. Now that we can see the content clearly without all that CSS in the way. Let's talk about it. Click on the tiny button in the top-left with the arrow or type CMD + SHIFT + C (mac)/Ctrl + SHIFT + C(Windows). Now move your mouse along the page to see all the elements of the page highlight as you hover over them. NOTE: If the elements are not highlighting repeat the previous instructions. You may have turned them off when they were already on. Move your cursor around until you can find the Header Element. How many Article Elements can you find? Can you find the HTML element? All of these elements are various building blocks (Objects) that were arranged in a certain way to build this page. Check it out: Back in the Console type: document.querySelectorAll(\"h1\").length + ENTER. What number was returned? You should have gotten 1 because there is only 1 <h1> element and there should only ever be 1 <h1> on any page! Try it again. Type: document.querySelectorAll(\"a\").length How many Anchor elements are there? What about document.querySelectorAll(\"article\").length ? Go ahead and change the argument between the () to any of the elements you see on the page or currently know about to see how many there are on the entire page. Do you know what this script is doing? Can you read it? It goes like this: \"Hey Console, ask the Document object to invoke its \"querySelectorAll\" method with \"a\" as its argument to find all Anchor elements, then give us the value of the length property on the object that method returns.\" The querySelectorAll method selects/finds all elements that match the argument you pass into. Give it \"h1\" and it'll return 1, give it \"section\" and it'll return 1, \"a\" will return 481. Go ahead and try any or all of the 115 different HTML elements to see what you find!

In fact, when your HTML, CSS, and JS code files are prepared for a production environment (open for the world to see) they are minified which means all of the whitespace is removed including space between words, space between lines of code, and indentations. Your files will be minified/compress so they are faster for the computer to run and lighter for the internet to transfer. So why indentation? Because code is also used to communicate to humans, we use indentation to organize objects; or rather representation of objects in our code. When you auto-generated your boilerplate HTML earlier there likely wasn't any indentation before the head and body elements/objects but in this code example there is. This extra whitespace is to help you start seeing these different objects using different vertical layers, indentation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 <!-- index.html --> <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"UTF-8\" > < meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" > < title > Document </ title > </ head > < body > < header ></ header > < main > < h1 > Hello World </ h1 > < section ></ section > < section ></ section > </ main > < footer ></ footer > </ body > </ html > The html element is the the top-level/root element so it is slammed up against the far-left side of file. But head and body are direct descendants of html and siblings to one-another; therefore they are indented one tab (2-4 spaces). Objects directly inside the head and body are thusly tabbed in again: meta , meta , and title . These element can be described as Siblings Elements . In the body we see some new elements.

No matter what programming language you work in, if you're serving your software through the web you'll be encoding that software's content to the user in HTML.

So when you're wondering when you'll know everything there is to know about HTML, well maybe never...but the upside is that there is always something to learn! In this lesson, we'll spend time on the Image Element, <img /> because during class and your upcoming career you'll need to display the images. We won't cover all of the \"special HTML elements\" a.k.a Replaced Elements : in this lesson like: <video> , <embed> and <iframe> but just know if you're wanting to build videos into a web page you can read the docs on these two elements and all the other HTML elements!! Using the Image Element You've probably already recognized the Image Element, <img /> , from a Learn-to-Code event or from your Portfolio Landing page. This takes the fear out of learning yet another Object-Thing ! To begin, the <img /> known as a self-closing or void element because it doesn't keep its content between the opening- and closing-tags like most other HTML elements do, instead it uses two properties/ attributes to source its content: src=\"\" - the source of the actual image in the form of a URL or pathname alt=\"\" - A description used to replace the image if a person who is blind is using your web page. Take a look at the following code snippet: 1 2 3 4 < img src = \"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1590004987778-bece5c9adab6?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1502&q=80\" alt = \"Grapefruit wedges spaced evenly apart on orange background.\" /> Similar to src= attribute on the Script Element, <script src=\"\"> , the Image element sources its image with the same attribute, src=\"\" . While the alt=\"\" attribute stands for \"alternative text\" and is used in place of the image when it is not being displayed or when someone with a visual impairment visits your page. This \"alt\" text is required for screen readers\u2014accessibility devices used primarily by the visually impaired\u2014to be able to communicate image content to their users. For this reason, you should put lengthy and descriptive alternative text so that screen readers can actually communicate what is in the image. NOTE: It's important to know that a pathname and a URL are essentially the same thing but differ in a small but large ways: a pathname refers to a path from one file on your computer to another file on your computer, but a URL refers to a path from a file on your computer to a file on another computer that is connected to your computer through the internet. Both do the same thing because the storing structure of your computer, my computer, and everyone else's computers are the same. However, with a URL we use HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP(S). W3S Docs - Image Element Styling Images Styling Images can be tricky because they are a \"special element\" known as a Replaced Element . This means they don't quite follow the same CSS rules as most other elements. So the best way style an image is to put it inside a Div element and style the Div: The HTML 1 2 3 4 5 < div id = \"image-container\" > < img src = \"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/03/27/19/31/fashion-1283863_960_720.jpg\" alt = \"folded blue and white knit sweater on white background\" > </ div > The CSS 1 2 3 4 5 # image-container { margin : 1 % auto ; text-align : center ; padding : 5 % auto ; } In addition to styling an Image with a \"wrapper\" Div , Image elements have two special properties on them that control the content(the actual image) held within the Image Element object. They're called: object-fit - determines the size of the content(image) inside the Image object/element. object-position - determines the position of the content(image) inside or outside the Image object/element. The following code snippet would be paired with the code snippets you just saw above: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 /* styles.css file */ # image-container > img { object-fit : contain ; object-position : 50 % 50 % ; width : 250 px ; /* <-- image height is proportionally controlled with the width property */ } Try it. Go to the MDN Docs on object-position & object-fit and play! Image as Background Technique An alternative to styling an Image Element is setting the background of a Div Element to the image you want displayed: The HTML 1 2 <!-- HTML --> < div id = 'elephant-pic' ></ div > The CSS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 /* the CSS */ . elephant-pic { width : 300 pt ; height : 200 pt ; background-image : url ( ./images/Elephant-At-Sunrise.png ); background-size : cover ; background-repeat : no-repeat ; } The Result This last technique is convenient but comes with the drawback of not being Semantic .

Yet, before you take on the world let's learn just two more skills: Input elements and how to create new Elements. Using the Input Element The first is actually very easy and will boost your skillset tremendously! The input element is by far the most used element on the web simply because it can be for so many things: checkboxes, radio buttons, email, password, paragraph, sliders, file uploaders, color pickers, and more!! The full list can be found at W3S Docs - Input Element . Its default mode is a short input box: <input /> . But using the type= attribute we can change it to be any of the types of input listed above including a button! Try it. In the same file create an <input type=\"submit\"></button element. The reason we have this option is that Input Elements normally go inside the Form Element and we need to distinguish them as submit buttons & reset buttons versus input type inputs. We'll get into the Form Element soon but for right now let's figure out how we can use the Input Element to take input from a human to later do something with it! The Input element, just like the Button element has many Events we can use to capture interactions and pass along data. The event we'll use for this example is the onkeydown event which gets fired when a human-user presses any key down while inside the input field. Other events get fired including onkeyup & onkeypress , you can study the full list of Global Events here, aka Event Listeners .

The only new bits of syntax you see here are this. , value=\" , and {input} . this is actually pretty easy, it refers to the exact object that is calling the function. If we created a new input and it called the same function the computer wouldn't know what to do because it wouldn't know how to call it. So we use the keyword this to communicate that the context were calling the function from is this object and not that object or any other object besides this object. value= is also easy because it's an attribute just like the other attributes we've been writing and refers to the property value on that object. Its current value is an empty string , \"\" but as we type, the value will change under-the-hood. To see this change we need to pass that value along to a function to do something with it. The last bit is super easy. You can see the input appear in the console without the {} but with the curly-braces we just see the data in a cleaner format: an object with a key called input that has a value of whatever the input is. If this is confusing, just remove the {} around {input} . Using Variables To Hold Values We already know how to create variables with the let keyword and we know that we need to use variables to hold on to pieces of data. Let's create a variable that can hold onto our user's input so we can do other things besides logging it in the Console object... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > <!-- more code is here.. --> < input value = \"\" onkeyup = \"setValue(this.value)\" /> < script > let usersInput ; // and more JS code is here... function setValue ( input ) { usersInput = input console . log ({ usersInput }) } </ script > </ body > Note the changes in the code: We're now saving our data to a variable and logging the value of the variable, usersInput instead of directly logging what comes into the function's parameter , input .

Its current value is an empty string , \"\" but as we type, the value will change under-the-hood. To see this change we need to pass that value along to a function to do something with it. The last bit is super easy. You can see the input appear in the console without the {} but with the curly-braces we just see the data in a cleaner format: an object with a key called input that has a value of whatever the input is.

It was very hacky but it got the job done. Today, <table> isn't used as often but it is still a viable way to structure pieces of our page especially if we need to represent something in a table chart. We'll learn to use the <table> element and its dedicated child elements as we build our Tic Tac Toe board next class!! What Are HTML Tables But first, what is an HTML Table? Well, it looks a lot like a spreadsheet: HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 < table > < thead > < th > Company </ th > < th > Contact </ th > < th > Country </ th > </ thead > < tbody > < tr > < td > Alfreds Futterkiste </ td > < td > Maria Anders </ td > < td > Germany </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Centro comercial Moctezuma </ td > < td > Francisco Chang </ td > < td > Mexico </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Ernst Handel </ td > < td > Roland Mendel </ td > < td > Austria </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Island Trading </ td > < td > Helen Bennett </ td > < td > UK </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Laughing Bacchus Winecellars </ td > < td > Yoshi Tannamuri </ td > < td > Canada </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Magazzini Alimentari Riuniti </ td > < td > Giovanni Rovelli </ td > < td > Italy </ td > </ tr > </ tbody > < tfoot > Notes about the companies would go here. </ tfoot > </ table > Result The Tags of the Table So what's happening? Notice how there are HTML tags you haven't seen before like: <td> , <tr> , and <th> ? These elements are reserved for use only within the <table></table> element because the <table> element has properties reserved for those elements: <td> , <tr> , and <th> , so that each of them \"snaps\" into place when they're written inside the dedicated parent element, <table> . Check it out: the <tr> element stands for Table Row which, as you guessed, creates a row in our tables. The <th> element creates another table row but is actually called a Table Header because it labels the columns of our table. The <td> element creates the columns within each row. This element is used within the <tr></tr> element. Then, of course, there's <thead> , <tbody> , and <tfoot> which you might have guessed stand for Table Head , Table Body, and Table Footer. These elements are used as sort of a \"Parent Row\" to section off the top of the table, then the main part of table: <tbody> , and the footer of the table: <tfoot> . They are optional elements but very useful when creating an organized table. Special Attributes The child elements of <table> : <tr> and <td> have the same styling properties as the other elements you've learned about so far like border , padding , text-align and so forth. In addition to those typical properties we have the option to use the two attributes: colspan and rowspan . We might use colspan to create a header that covers multiple columns like: <th colspan=\"2\">Employee Name</th> where the first column might be the employee's first name and the second column could be their last name but we want them both to be labeled under one cell: \"Employee Name\". Essentially, it just makes that specific \"cell\" traverse or \"span\" the number of columns specified in the value. The same goes for rowspan . When using this attribute, the cell will traverse multiple rows: <tr rowspan=\"3\"> Top Three Earners: </tr> could be a cell on the far left of your table that relates to the three rows to the right of it... as in, it spans the height of three rows! A new CSS selector: :nth-child() The :nth-child() selector isn't specific to the <table> element but this is a nice place to learn about it because of the nature of a table chart: many rows and columns. With the :nth-child() pseudo selector we can select a specific number (n) of child elements. Let's say in the table we want the rows to be easier to read by having differently shaded backgrounds. In the () of :nth-child() we can specify odd and even to apply the background color we want for any number of rows that might be present in the table. The following code snippets will produce the screenshot you see below them: HTML 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 < table > < tr > < th > Firstname </ th > < th > Lastname </ th > < th > Age </ th > </ tr > < tr > < td > Jill </ td > < td > Smith </ td > < td > 50 </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > Eve </ td > < td > Jackson </ td > < td > 94 </ td > </ tr > < tr > < td > John </ td > < td > Doe </ td > < td > 80 </ td > </ tr > </ table > CSS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 table tr : nth-child ( even ) { background-color : lightgrey ; } table tr : nth-child ( odd ) { background-color : white ; } table th { background-color : black ; color : white ; } Result Did you notice in the CSS how the :nth-child() is placed on the tr element which is the one we want to be colored? Then did you notice how it was placed after the parent element: table ? If not, go back and look at how the CSS code is laid out. Try it yourself. And lastly, don't be scared of this selector. n just stands for a number to be specified, th is just a stand-in suffix for the general numbers like -nd , -rd , and -st as in \"2nd\" , \"3rd\" , and \"1st\" . But \"th\" is the most common so the developers of CSS decided on th . And -child just means its meant to be used on child elements, and with the exception of <body> , all elements are children of some other element/object.

It is where your body , header , footer , title , meta , and all other HTML elements are created. This \"Mother of All Objects\" has a whole list of properties and methods we can use, some of which you'll see in the video below. In this video , we'll cover a few things in a slow and careful way. Take your time through it and make sure you re-create the task on your own either in a new repo or a codePen. The following will make more sense if you watch the video above first. To begin, a Method is a special type of Property; in that, a property just holds a value like: font-size: 12pt . While a method looks the same as a property it is actually a Function stored in the value of the property name, i.e. write: function(){// code that writes to the document} . This subtle difference helps us understand what we're talking about in the future. Property - holds a value that represents a particular attribute. Method - a functionality of the object stored in an accessible location. Event Listener - a special function that \"listens\" for certain events, or interactions, in order to trigger a specified action when the \"event\" happens. In either case, when we access a property or a method we use Dot-Notation , aka the Member Operator . It looks like this: . . Seriously, to get the property write() on the Document Object, we type document.write() . Remember, the Document Object Model is a way we, as humans, can visualize the way these HTML Elements are written under-the-hood. NOTE: The following code snippet is not real code, just a representation that can help you visualize what methods look like on the Document Object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 docume nt = { addEve nt Lis tener : // a fun c t io n t ha t a tta ches a n eve nt ha n dler t o t he docume nt adop t Node : // a fun c t io n t ha t adop ts a n ode fr om a n o t her docume nt close : // a fun c t io n t ha t closes t he ou t pu t s trea m previously ope ne d wi t h docume nt .ope n () crea te A ttr ibu te : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n a ttr ibu te n ode // crea te Comme nt : a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a Comme nt n ode wi t h t he speci f ied te x t crea te Docume nt Fragme nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n emp t y Docume nt Fragme nt n ode crea te Eleme nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n Eleme nt n ode crea te Eve nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a ne w eve nt } STOP! It's important you don't get overwhelmed with all of these methods . You don't need to know all of them or even most of them. You'll only use a few of them for the majority of your career. In the video above we only use document.getElementById() . For a full list of the available document methods visit and bookmark the docs page . document.getElementById() Just like we use Selectors in CSS to access a specific element and change its properties, in JavaScript, we have access to a few methods that help us get elements by their specific attributes or type. The getElementById() method is a very common method that accesses an element by an id. In the video above we use it to \"grab\" an element then change its style.display property. There are many other methods to get an element by its class name or data or type. For now, all you need to know is that they exist and when you need to use them there are docs you can reference . onclick= & Event Listeners It's a little confusing at first but I think you'll get the hang of it. While the Document Object has methods like the one we just discussed, each and every HTML element also has methods available to them. The methods are usually associated with the action of a user interacting with it so we call them Event Listeners . They listen for Events , or interactions, between the user and objects in the Document Object Model( DOM ). One of the most common Event Listeners to use is onclick . It, of course, listens for a click from the user's mouse. When the user clicks on that element an event bubbles up and we we can point that action to trigger something to happen, like a function to load more pictures or login. In the video above, we use the user's click to trigger a function that sets the element's display property to none so it disappears from the page. HTML 1 < button onlick = \"sayHello()\" > Click To See a Greeting </ button > JS 1 2 3 function sayHello () { window . alert ( \"Hello\" ) } There are many Event Listeners so just breathe for now and be happy that you know this one. But if you're looking for more there are always more docs to study . JS Keywords Use let to Declare Variables Just the same way CSS and HTML have specific words that mean something to the browser, so does JavaScript. In HTML we have words like <section> and class=\"\" and in CSS we have color: and solid . JavaScript has a whole set of keywords we'll learn to use in time but the first one we need is: let , as in let me store something here. When we program we usually need a place to store data. This data could be a number, a word, an HTML Element, or a function. Whatever it is, we need to store it for later use. In the above video we used two variables to hold two numbers: 70 & 5 . Then we add them together by referencing their variable name and not the numbers themselves. We also used the keyword const but you'll regularly see let and var . I will now break these three words down once and for all while I continue to reinforce how/when to use them as we learn more about programming. var is the old way to declare a variable. We don't use it anymore but you will still see it in old code bases. let is used when we expect for the value of the variable to change. we use const when we expect for the value to stay the same. We'll get into the nitty gritty of this later on but for now just know that's why there are two different words to do the \"same\" thing. For now, let 's just use the keyword let to declare and define all of our variables. 1 2 let aVariable = 7 let anotherVariable = \"hello\" Function Signatures In the video you two different ways to declare functions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 function myFunction () { // this is the old way of declaring a function in JS } const myFunction2 = () => { // this is the new and preferred way of declaring a function in JS } Again, there is an old way and a new way to write functions in JS. You'll still see the old way so we must teach you it but you'll learn to write functions in the new format. You also so something like this written in the HTML: 1 2 myFunction () // this is how we invoke a function in JS myFunction2 () // no matter how the function is declared in JS The difference between these two examples is subtle but vastly different! The first, const myFunction2 = () => {} & function myFunction() {} , is a Function Signature or Function Declaration . This is where we write the instructions to be used later.

It is where your body , header , footer , title , meta , and all other HTML elements are created. This \"Mother of All Objects\" has a whole list of properties and methods we can use, some of which you'll see in the video below. In this video , we'll cover a few things in a slow and careful way. Take your time through it and make sure you re-create the task on your own either in a new repo or a codePen. The following will make more sense if you watch the video above first. To begin, a Method is a special type of Property; in that, a property just holds a value like: font-size: 12pt . While a method looks the same as a property it is actually a Function stored in the value of the property name, i.e. write: function(){// code that writes to the document} . This subtle difference helps us understand what we're talking about in the future. Property - holds a value that represents a particular attribute. Method - a functionality of the object stored in an accessible location. Event Listener - a special function that \"listens\" for certain events, or interactions, in order to trigger a specified action when the \"event\" happens. In either case, when we access a property or a method we use Dot-Notation , aka the Member Operator . It looks like this: . . Seriously, to get the property write() on the Document Object, we type document.write() . Remember, the Document Object Model is a way we, as humans, can visualize the way these HTML Elements are written under-the-hood. NOTE: The following code snippet is not real code, just a representation that can help you visualize what methods look like on the Document Object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 docume nt = { addEve nt Lis tener : // a fun c t io n t ha t a tta ches a n eve nt ha n dler t o t he docume nt adop t Node : // a fun c t io n t ha t adop ts a n ode fr om a n o t her docume nt close : // a fun c t io n t ha t closes t he ou t pu t s trea m previously ope ne d wi t h docume nt .ope n () crea te A ttr ibu te : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n a ttr ibu te n ode // crea te Comme nt : a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a Comme nt n ode wi t h t he speci f ied te x t crea te Docume nt Fragme nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n emp t y Docume nt Fragme nt n ode crea te Eleme nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a n Eleme nt n ode crea te Eve nt : // a fun c t io n t ha t crea tes a ne w eve nt } STOP! It's important you don't get overwhelmed with all of these methods . You don't need to know all of them or even most of them. You'll only use a few of them for the majority of your career.

The getElementById() method is a very common method that accesses an element by an id. In the video above we use it to \"grab\" an element then change its style.display property. There are many other methods to get an element by its class name or data or type.

While the Document Object has methods like the one we just discussed, each and every HTML element also has methods available to them. The methods are usually associated with the action of a user interacting with it so we call them Event Listeners . They listen for Events , or interactions, between the user and objects in the Document Object Model( DOM ). One of the most common Event Listeners to use is onclick . It, of course, listens for a click from the user's mouse. When the user clicks on that element an event bubbles up and we we can point that action to trigger something to happen, like a function to load more pictures or login. In the video above, we use the user's click to trigger a function that sets the element's display property to none so it disappears from the page. HTML 1 < button onlick = \"sayHello()\" > Click To See a Greeting </ button > JS 1 2 3 function sayHello () { window . alert ( \"Hello\" ) } There are many Event Listeners so just breathe for now and be happy that you know this one.

JavaScript has a whole set of keywords we'll learn to use in time but the first one we need is: let , as in let me store something here. When we program we usually need a place to store data. This data could be a number, a word, an HTML Element, or a function. Whatever it is, we need to store it for later use. In the above video we used two variables to hold two numbers: 70 & 5 . Then we add them together by referencing their variable name and not the numbers themselves. We also used the keyword const but you'll regularly see let and var . I will now break these three words down once and for all while I continue to reinforce how/when to use them as we learn more about programming. var is the old way to declare a variable. We don't use it anymore but you will still see it in old code bases. let is used when we expect for the value of the variable to change. we use const when we expect for the value to stay the same. We'll get into the nitty gritty of this later on but for now just know that's why there are two different words to do the \"same\" thing.

Perspective Two: We use code to organize our thoughts about how to access that memory and give instructions on what to do with that memory to both the computer and other human-beings(fellow developers). In the next session we'll explore the following questions: How do we accomplish the invisible task of seeing the memory of computers? How does code represent our programming intentions to the computer? To do this we'll break them down in three parts: Objects , Object Modeling , Code as Communication . Part One: Objects Computers don't have eyes or ears...yet. They can't see a dog and hear a bark; therefore, they can't perceive the animal before them is a canine and not a feline. Instead they rely on objects, and categories of objects to interact with the world. So that dog would become an object with properties like: wagsTail=true, barks=true, licks=true, species=\"canine\" . With this object and its properties the computer could categorize the animal as a dog type object but when it is given another animal with properties: wagsTail=false, barks=false, licks=true, species=\"feline\", isSelfCentered=true then it can categorize that animal as a cat type object. Everything is an object to the computer. It's how it relates to the world around it. People are objects, foods are objects, vehicles are objects. With so many objects, it would stand to reason that there would be types of objects/categories to put similarly related types of objects in. So cars, trucks, motorcycles, buses, scooters they could all be Vehicle type objects, objects that are of Vehicle type. This is the same with the components you see on your screen when you open a page. Your browser creates an object called window . And the website you navigate to sends information back to your browser to create another object called document which gets mounted inside of window . Inside this document object there are many other objects. Typical objects inside the document object include header , body , and footer , among many more. These are by no means all of the possible objects but they are the general first objects to build a web page. Try it out: Go to any website and right-click your mouse, Then click \"Inspect\" to open your Developer Tools. Next click on Console and type window + ENTER where the cursor is flashing. You should get something like this returned on the next line: Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: \"\", location: Location, \u2026} What you did was ask the console object to access the window object and give you information about it. What you're seeing is the object literal (literally the object written in JS) with its properties: window , self , document , location , etc... We'll be using the console much more in the future and diving much deeper into all the objects mentioned above but before we do we have to get a mental \"model\" of all of these objects in our minds! The third thing to keep in mind ! Part Two: Object Modeling Object Modeling is the process of seeing the objects of the computer and how they relate to one another in our minds so we can effectively communicate with ourselves and one another about what is happening inside and between computers. To model these objects, we can imagine them in our minds, draw them on whiteboards, and even have graphic representations for them on our screen. This type of thinking is the intermediary between what the computer understands and what we humans understand. It is imperative that we practice Object Modeling every time we approach the building of a site or page because it will act as our map and compass for solving problems we've never seen. Objects are just slots of memory that represent real-world things. So what does an object look like? What model can we use to describe them? Try first to write it down, draw it, and then imagine it. This will take some time. But try! Draw a large box nearly the size of a sheet of notebook paper. At the top label it window . Inside draw another box nearly 3/4 the size of the first box. Label this one document . Inside the window box create two lists titled: \"Properties\" & \"Methods\" Under the \"Properties\" list write down the first five properties you find at this website: W3S Window Object NOTICE: The 2nd property is \"Console\" and the 4th is \"Document\" These are two objects you've already come across; the \"Console\" is the one you opened in your Inspect > Developer Tools earlier and typed \"window\". And the \"Document\" is the other box on your page!! In the \"Methods\" list write the first 5 methods you see on that same website: W3S Window Object Repeat these steps for the smaller box, the \"Document\" object, but with this page instead: W3S Document Object NOTE: the ones with parenthesis, () following them are methods and the ones without are properties. What you see on your paper is a simple model of two objects, Window and Document, and shorts lists of each of their properties and methods. This is Object Modeling. And this is how we will talk about EVERYTHING we learn. Everything is an object with properties, methods, and events. To continue on this Object Modeling exploration we'll need to cover some new terms: Properties , Methods , and Events . These three new terms are called the members of an object. Properties All objects have properties . Properties are descriptions of the object. If you were an object you would have properties that might include: name: , gender: , height: , weight: , age: , DOB: , job: . The same goes for our web page objects. All visible objects have color: , height: , width: , z-index: , font-size: , etc... Properties are things that describe what something is, what it contains, and what it looks like when rendered. You'll also see properties referred to as attributes and keys while the value that is assigned to each of them (the part after the colon and before comma) is called a value leading to the common expression: key/value pairs , i.e. name: \"Rebecca\", , age: 33, or width: 500px, Methods Most objects have methods . Methods are like special properties in that they don't describe the object but instead they describe actions the object can do! You might have methods like eat() , sleep() , run() , and beStill() . However, as you saw in your exercise, objects on our web pages might have methods like: confirm() , clearInterval() , createElement() , execCommand() and open() because they are computer object-things and not human-being things with needs like food, water, and shelter. Methods are also called built-in functions because they work like functions. They're small sets of instructions that can be executed just like other functions. Now, we haven't fully covered functions yet but suffice it to say that if you just learned how to mix cocktails you would now have two new functions written into your system that are maybe called: mixIngredients() and shakeVigoursly() . So every time you need to make a cocktail for your party you would first call mixIngredients() then shakeVigoursly() . Not everyone needs or wants to learn how to make cocktails but everyone needs to eat, sleep, and drink. So the good Lord gave us all built-in functions/ methods called: sleep() , eat() , and drink() . In web development, the reason we have methods is because some functions need to be called regularly, by all developers for most apps and don't need to be special or customized. So the engineers of HTML created \"built-in functions\" that are readily available to be used by us. The \"built-in\" functions are methods . Events Most objects also have a third category of members called Events . You can think of events as interactions. Interactions that happen between objects and other objects or objects and humans. See, we can move our mouse, place our cursor on an element on our screen, and click on that element. In that single move there are three distinct events/interactions that happen: 1) onmousemove , onmouseenter , and onmousedown . The events are built into objects so that they can be interacted with. We people have events like: lookedAt , smiledAt , handShaked , poked , hugged , shoved , greeted . All of these are ways in which our bodies are interacted with in the world around them. In web development terms, these Events are used to \"capture\" an interaction and then trigger an action because of it. For the most part all of these built-in events are attached to a \"blank\"; in that, they fire every time the event happens but nothing is triggered. It's up to us, the developer to create the reactions and then attach them to the events. So we might say something like: onmouseenter=\"openGreetingWindow()\" . This could be equivalent to our bodies being programmed with: smiledAt=\"smileBack()\" . At this point you may be a bit confused on the difference between methods and events so for now separate them by this distinctions: Events capture interactions with the object from the outside world, in order for us to attach instructions to be carried out when the event happens. Methods are actions(built-in functions) the object can use to outwardly interact with its world. And properties are bits of information that describe the object. Often called attributes , as well. While object modeling is a great way to understand how a computer interacts with the world it is not how we communicate to the computer our programming intentions. The computer, frankly doesn't know anything about this Object Modeling stuff. It just knows about objects because what we interpret as a \"model\" is the complete and total reality of a computer. It knows nothing else. Because of this, we have to use a language that communicates to the computer our intentions with its objects and their subsequent properties, methods, and events. This language is what we generally call code . The great thing about you learning code now is that you've already built things with three different coding languages and you've been reading code in all of these textual examples. Part Three: Code as Communication In order for us to communicate our programming needs and intentions we need a language that can be interpreted by the computer and understood by humans. This is what we call code . Code comes in many different names and flavors that we call languages, or programming languages . We use programming languages to communicate to both humans and computers what our programming needs and intentions are. Notice earlier, we used the word \"interpret\" for computers and \"understand\" for humans. This is because, as long as your fellow developers know the syntax and semantics of the language you chose to write, they will understand what you meant. But the computer must \"interpret\" what you wrote because the computer doesn't actually know JavaScript from Closure or Haskell. Our computers use interpreters that convert your programming language of choice to binary before it executes the program you built. Programming languages are similar to our human languages in that they were all created to represent and communicate our needs and intentions. It doesn't matter what language you are speaking...as long as you are speaking to someone who understands the language they will know what you're saying. This goes for computers as well. When we're building websites and web app we're talking to web browsers who know three languages: HTML, JS, and CSS. If we are building iOS apps we're talking to an operating system that understands Swift and if we're build apps for Android we're talking to a system that understands Java. All languages are built in similar ways because they all have to accomplish the same goals: store data, move data, and render data. In this way, you can feel confident that once you now how to program in JavaScript, learning to program with Python, Swift, Java, Go, or C# will come much easier! This layer of \"abstraction\" is not so important for us to learn, so much, as it is helpful for us to understand that programming languages like JavaScript are just languages with nouns, verbs, sentence structure, actions, and objects that all represent to the computer our programming needs and intention of how to we would like to move, manipulate, and display the objects our computers know about. In Summary: Our Three Jobs, Object Modeling & Code as Communication Now that we've learned our three jobs as web developers are to store, move, and render data inside an invisible world with 10 levels of abstractions on a computer that sees only objects with properties, methods, & events and interprets only code it recognizes we have our work cut out for us. How do we do it? We first have to remember that our three jobs as web developers is to store data, move data, and render data. The next is to always draw out our objects on paper, whiteboard and in our mind so we don't forget that everything is an object. Third, we have to practice gratitude for the languages we get to learn and be happy that we get to create stories and books with these programming languages instead of new words for every thought. After that, we must always reference our docs. Docs are how to learn and remember object, properties, methods, and events . And lastly, we have to keep learning and trusting that you can do this !","title":"Two Perspectives"},{"location":"module-2/twoPerspectives/#the-two-perspectives-object-modeling","text":"Perspective One: Objects are how the computer keeps up with memory and interacts with the world and people around it?

The next is to always draw out our objects on paper, whiteboard and in our mind so we don't forget that everything is an object. Third, we have to practice gratitude for the languages we get to learn and be happy that we get to create stories and books with these programming languages instead of new words for every thought. After that, we must always reference our docs. Docs are how to learn and remember object, properties, methods, and events . And lastly, we have to keep learning and trusting that you can do this !","title":"In Summary: Our Three Jobs, Object Modeling &amp; Code as Communication"},{"location":"module-2/video-iframe-elements/","text":"The Video Element \u201cIn a time of destruction, create something.\u201d \u2015Maxine Hong Kingston Overview Continuing on with our Special HTML Element Week , we're going to cover two important elements today: <video> & <iframe> . These elements are similar to the <img/> element but have some funny but useful attributes to play with. The Video Element & Its Attributes The <video> tag creates an HTML Video Element that will embed a media player into a page. This allows the user to interact with video playback inside the document . Just as you learned with the <img /> element, the video element will get its content via the path to the media file specified inside a src=\"\" attribute. Videos also come with the width & height attribute just like the element. But a few more attributes you haven't seen before include: autoplay - sets the element's autoplay property to true which tells the browser to play the video as soon as the page loads. controls - sets the element's controls property to true which provides built-in play/pause buttons and a tracking slider. poster - means thumbnail, which is the initial image you see before a video plays. If this attribute isn't specified the browser will use the first frame in the video. This attribute takes a pathname or URL. muted - sets the element's muted property to true which means the video will begin with no volume. loop - sets the element's loop property to true which means the video will play again when it finishes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 < video src = \"./videos/myMovie.mp4\" width = \"320\" height = \"240\" poster = \"./images/myMovieThumbnail.png\" autoplay controls > < video > Video Sources The <video> element is pretty versatile. In fact, you can use it to provide multiple types of video files for multiple browsers. Say if you used .webm as a video format for Chrome but a user came to your site using Safari which only supports .mp4 format you could deliver to them the \"same video\" through different formats by creating two <source> elements as child elements inside the parent <video> element. Check it out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <!-- HTML for Multiple Possible Sources Video Elements --> < video width = \"320\" height = \"240\" poster = \"./images/myMovieThumbnail.png\" autoplay controls muted > <!-- If using Chrome, this video will be shown --> < source src = \"./videos/myMovie.webm\" type = \"video/webm\" /> <!-- If using Safari or other browsers that don't support .webm then use this video --> < source src = \"./videos/myMovie.mp4\" type = \"video/mp4\" /> <!-- And if neither are supported, give them this text as a default. --> < p > Your browser doesn't support the HTML5 Video Element. Here is a < a href = \"https://www.youtube.com/myhandle/myVideo\" > link to the video instead. </ a > </ p > </ video > NOTE: the <source /> tag, like <img /> , is self-closing, having no closing tag paired with it. In the new HTML5 specifications, it is optional to include the slash (conventionally written with a space preceding it) before the final angle bracket ( i.e., <source> works just as well as <source /> ). HTML5 simply ignores the slash, but some technologies that intersect with HTML ( such as XML, and the JSX language used with React ) do require the slash; so it doesn't hurt to develop the habit of using it in elements that don't have closing tags, which are called void elements . NOTE 2: Do you see where we placed a <p> tag in our <video> element? This serves as something like an alt=\"\" text? In case the video doesn't load for the user, we explain the reason for this in the <p> tag, and provide a URL link to the youTube version of the same video in the <a> tag. The IFrame Element So the <video> element is pretty straight-forward but remember, it is only used when you own the content, as in, it resides on your server. So what do you do if you don't own the content? Say for a youTube video? Well, that's where we use an Inline Frame element . The <iframe> represents a nested browsing window, which effectively embeds another HTML page within the current page. You can include any number of <iframe> elements inside the <body> of a document, each of them displaying a separate page in the area covered by the <iframe> . While it can be used to display video, the <iframe> can also be used for things like games, code snippets for CodePen or Repl.it, and advertising. When it comes to video, <iframe> is used primarily when we are linking to the video on YouTube or Vimeo rather than storing the file on our server. IFrame Caution You should know there are some security risks involved with the <iframe> element. The risk revolve around the fact that you are \"effectively embed[ding] another HTML page within the current page\". We won't go into the technicalities of this because it is beyond the scope of this course but you should be aware as you move forward.

In fact, it has 31 properties, 26 methods, and 80 events in total. You can learn to use each of them by reading the documentation on them. For now, let's look at two of them .open() and .close() just to get familiar with the process of using them. Window.open & Window.close Methods These methods, respectively, open and close a new window. Use that code you've been playing with to follow along: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <!-- 101-onlineClothingStore/index.html --> < body > < button onclick = \"sayHello();\" > Click Me </ button > < button onclick = \"sayHi();\" > Click Me Too </ button > < button onclick = \"openANewWindow();\" > Open </ button > < script > let secondWindow ; function sayHello (){ alert ( 'Hello, Window.alert Method!' ) }; function sayHi (){ console . log ( 'Hi, Console.log Method!' ) }; function openANewWindow () { secondWindow = window . open ( \"\" , \"myWindow\" , \"width=400, height=300\" ); } </ script > </ body > There are a few more bits of syntax to take in. We created a new function called openANewWindow and call it with a new button to onclick event. But there's something new going on at the top of the Script element and inside the openANewWindow function declaration. The let keyword you see up there signifies a place to hold a bit of data. We call this a variable because the bit of data that's held in these things usually change and we don't always know what value will be there, we just know we'll need to reference it later. Think of how you might build a calculator. When the user types the first input you only know the number could be between -\u221e and \u221e; the same goes for the second input. Because of this programming challenge we have to create a place for the values the user inputs to be held until we know if we're going to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers. This \"place to hold values\" is called a variable and we use the keyword let to communicate that in JavaScript. After the keyword let we see secondWindow . This is the name of the variable and it\u2019s used just the same way we name our functions, so we can reference them later in our program. It's important to know you can name your variables anything you want as long as they don't begin with a number(0-9) and are not one of JavaScript's keywords . The second guideline about naming variables is that they usually have descriptive names and are camelCased ; secondWindow is a descriptive name for this variable it starts with a lower-case letter and has a capitalized letter at the beginning of its next word. This particular variable would be described as declared but not defined . Try it. Go to your DevTools, open the console tab and type secondWindow + Enter . What do you get? You should get \"undefined\" as a return value. This is because the variable, the space for data, is declared but it has no value. Click the \"Open\" Button and re-type secondWindow in the console. What do you get? You should get something like: Window {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: \"myWindow\", location: Location, \u2026} - This is another Window object opened by the browser and the properties and values you see listed are the key/value pairs of that new Window Object. The reason you're able to see these properties is because you saved a reference to this new Window object in the variable secondWindow and are now listing that data out in the Console.

I needed the push. Now, more than ever, young women need more seasoned women to provide that encouragement, to take a risk, to go for it. Once a glass ceiling is broken, it stays broken.\u201d \u2013Jennifer Grahnolm Overview Functions may seem scary at first but if you think of them in the same way CSS rules are built, they're actually the same thing! See when you select an element and give it rules those rules are like a function waiting to be called. Usually they're called when the web page loads. Or, if you use a pseudo selector, the rule is called when the user does the thing you were looking for like a :hover . In this same way, JavaScript functions are just recipes or sets of instructions waiting to be called and used when they're needed! Obviously you've already worked with some JavaScript in a few of your projects but starting today we're going to slow down a little to focus on JavaScript. It can be a little harder to grasp than CSS but I think if you work to ask questions, answer your own questions, and ask more questions then you'll get this very quickly! What is Syntax? Syntax is a funny word and not often used outside of programming. But, in fact, this word was used before programming was created. A Google Search provides the following: \"the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. From the Greek, Suntaxis, - To arrange together.\" What this means for us is that certain keywords and characters must go in specific order for the computer to interpret what we're trying to tell it. Just the same with CSS we have a Selector , Property , Value and Declaration Block and with HTML we have an Opening Tag , <h3> and a Closing Tag , </h3> , we have specific syntax for JavaScript functions, as well. Take a look: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Function Declaration const separateWord = ( word ) => { // Function Body (between the { } ) const splitUpWord = word . split ( \"\" ) // Function Return Statement return splitUpWord } The code snippet above: creates a function called separateWord which takes in a parameter named word and creates a new variable inside its Function Body called splitUpWord then assigns this new variable's value to what the method .split() returns when 5. it is called on the word that is given to the function. After this the function returns the value of splitUpWord . If we called this function with the word: \"Balloon\" like so, separateWord(\"Balloon\") we would expect it to return the following: [\"B\", \"a\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\", \"o\", \"n\", ] 1 separateWord ( \"Balloon\" ) What Can We Learn From This? In this small example you can deduce that JavaScript, like CSS and HTML reads from top to bottom and left to right. We call this Synchronous , or that each action happens after the last action is finished, one at a time. We can also see that a function is created the same way a variable is created, using the const keyword and then naming it what we'd like to name it. Next we see that, besides having to use the JavaScript Language Specific Keywords like const , .split() and return we as the developer get to decided on the names of our functions and variable. In the snippet above we get to decide the name of separateWord , word and splitUpWord . We could have just as easily named these crumble , cookie , or chip and the program would have still done the exact same thing! Now we can focus in on the characters or tokens used in sequential order. After the name of the function, separateWord we see the following characters: = () => {} these character go in order every time you create a function and you can read them aloud to yourself like this: \"Create a variable called separateWord that equals a function and returns the following...\" Where: 1 2 3 4 5 * `const` - \"Create a variable...\" * `separateWord` - \"...called separateWord...\" * `=` - \"...that equals...\" * `()` - \"...a function...\" * `=> {}` - \"...and returns the following...\" So you see then that a pair of parenthesis, () signifies a function in JavaScript. This is where we declare parameters when we declare a functions and where to pass in arguments when we call/invoke a function. A Fat Arrow , => shows that it returns whatever follows, and a pair of curly-braces, {} , (just like CSS), is a block of code to be run when the function is called. Alternative Syntax We've just covered the preferred way to create a JavaScript function, now we'll show you the older way to create a function. This way is still used and you might even use it later on in your coursework and career but for now just know that it exists but that we'll use the preferred signature, (detailed above), throughout this course. 1 2 3 4 5 function separateWord ( word ) { const splitUpWord = word . split ( \"\" ) return splitUpWord } This method uses the reserved word function to declare the same function as we saw above. It has it's purposes but for now let's just let it reside in our awareness. Invoke a JavaScript Function Declaring a function is the hard part. It's where you write out the steps you want your computer to do when that function is called but when the computer reads the function declaration it doesn't run the code. Instead it just stores it in memory as a set of instructions to do before it's time to run them. Therefore, invoking or calling a function is when the function is actually run. The syntax of this is really simple, it looks like this: myFunction() . That's it! Seriously, when ever we want your computer to run a function you've built you give it a simple line: thFunctionsName() where the name of the function is followed by a pair of parenthesis, () . Parameters vs Arguments Not all functions have parameters . Parameter are bits of data that functions hold on to and use to make calculations or perform specific tasks on like our separateWord example above. That function example had a parameter we called word. Which means, we the function is called it needs a piece of data like a word, or string , given to it so it can perform the tasks it's supposed to perform. When we give, or pass , data to a function we call it an argument . Below is an example of two functions. One requires a parameter and the other does not. Then you'll see them both invoked, one with an argument passed to it and the other without. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 // requires an argument to be passed to it because it has a parameter defined as \"username\" const sayHi = ( username ) => { greetingString = \"Hi, \" + username + \"!\" return greetingString } // doesn't require an argument because it has no parameters defined const sayHello = () => { return \"Hello!\" } // This line will return: \"Hi, Greta!\" because we passed it an argument: \"Greta\" sayHi ( \"Greta\" ) // This next line will return: \"Hello!\" sayHello () As We Move Forward As we add more to our JavaScript knowledge base you'll see methods like .split() used again and again. So let's take a minute to cover three aspects that will give us a solid foundation of what they are and how they're being used. Aspect 1 . Just like the methods you're used to on the document or on each of the HTML Elements, methods in JavaScript are built-in to the language and are specific to the Data Types just like certain methods are specific to certain HTML Elements. In the case of .split() , this method is specific to the String data type, or words/characters inside a pair of quotes, \" \" . You can't call this method on a Number data type because it doesn't exist on Number types of data! So you can start thinking of the Data Types a lot like the Elements we create on the DOM Tree. They are plain object-things we can't see but have many little properties we can access on the back side of them. Aspect 2 . The syntax of .split() looks just like the syntax of Invoking a JavaScript function we built ourselves. That's because it is. These methods were built by the developers of the JavaScript language and reside under-the-hood. We don't have to build them, all we have to do is read the docs on them and know how to use them. Aspect 3 . The .split() method returns a funny looking thing called an Array . ( Remember, [\"B\", \"a\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\", \"o\", \"n\", ] from above? ) This is another type of data in JavaScript which we're going to dig into in the next lesson. It's important to understand simply that each type of data or data type has utility for specific scenarios. The Array data type has the most built-in methods so it's often advantageous to convert data like a string to an array. You'll see in the next lesson!! Practice It Go to W3Schools JavaScript Exercises and complete the first 15 challenges in JS Variables, JS Operators , JS Data Types , and JS Functions . HINT: in JS Data Types you'll be asked about a data type we haven't covered in length yet. It's an Object.
